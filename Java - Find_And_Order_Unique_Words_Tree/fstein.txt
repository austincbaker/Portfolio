YOU
WILL
REJOICE
TO
HEAR
THAT
NO
DISASTER
HAS
ACCOMPANIED
THE
COMMENCEMENT
OF
AN
ENTERPRISE
WHICH
YOU
HAVE
REGARDED
WITH
SUCH
EVIL
FOREBODINGS
I
ARRIVED
HERE
YESTERDAY
AND
MY
FIRST
TASK
IS
TO
ASSURE
MY
DEAR
SISTER
OF
MY
WELFARE
AND
INCREASING
CONFIDENCE
IN
THE
SUCCESS
OF
MY
UNDERTAKING
I
AM
ALREADY
FAR
NORTH
OF
LONDON
AND
AS
I
WALK
IN
THE
STREETS
OF
PETERSBURGH
I
FEEL
A
COLD
NORTHERN
BREEZE
PLAY
UPON
MY
CHEEKS
WHICH
BRACES
MY
NERVES
AND
FILLS
ME
WITH
DELIGHT
DO
YOU
UNDERSTAND
THIS
FEELING
THIS
BREEZE
WHICH
HAS
TRAVELLED
FROM
THE
REGIONS
TOWARDS
WHICH
I
AM
ADVANCING
GIVES
ME
A
FORETASTE
OF
THOSE
ICY
CLIMES
INSPIRITED
BY
THIS
WIND
OF
PROMISE
MY
DAYDREAMS
BECOME
MORE
FERVENT
AND
VIVID
I
TRY
IN
VAIN
TO
BE
PERSUADED
THAT
THE
POLE
IS
THE
SEAT
OF
FROST
AND
DESOLATION
IT
EVER
PRESENTS
ITSELF
TO
MY
IMAGINATION
AS
THE
REGION
OF
BEAUTY
AND
DELIGHT
THERE
MARGARET
THE
SUN
IS
FOREVER
VISIBLE
ITS
BROAD
DISK
JUST
SKIRTING
THE
HORIZON
AND
DIFFUSING
A
PERPETUAL
SPLENDOUR
THEREFOR
WITH
YOUR
LEAVE
MY
SISTER
I
WILL
PUT
SOME
TRUST
IN
PRECEDING
NAVIGATORSTHERE
SNOW
AND
FROST
ARE
BANISHED
AND
SAILING
OVER
A
CALM
SEA
WE
MAY
BE
WAFTED
TO
A
LAND
SURPASSING
IN
WONDERS
AND
IN
BEAUTY
EVERY
REGION
HITHERTO
DISCOVERED
ON
THE
HABITABLE
GLOBE
ITS
PRODUCTIONS
AND
FEATURES
MAY
BE
WITHOUT
EXAMPLE
AS
THE
PHENOMENA
OF
THE
HEAVENLY
BODIES
UNDOUBTEDLY
ARE
IN
THOSE
UNDISCOVERED
SOLITUDES
WHAT
MAY
NOT
BE
EXPECTED
IN
A
COUNTRY
OF
ETERNAL
LIGHT
I
MAY
THERE
DISCOVER
THE
WONDROUS
POWER
WHICH
ATTRACTS
THE
NEEDLE
AND
MAY
REGULATE
A
THOUSAND
CELESTIAL
OBSERVATIONS
THAT
REQUIRE
ONLY
THIS
VOYAGE
TO
RENDER
THEIR
SEEMING
ECCENTRICITIES
CONSISTENT
FOREVER
I
SHALL
SATIATE
MY
ARDENT
CURIOSITY
WITH
THE
SIGHT
OF
A
PART
OF
THE
WORLD
NEVER
BEFORE
VISITED
AND
MAY
TREAD
A
LAND
NEVER
BEFORE
IMPRINTED
BY
THE
FOOT
OF
MAN
THESE
ARE
MY
ENTICEMENTS
AND
THEY
ARE
SUFFICIENT
TO
CONQUER
ALL
FEAR
OF
DANGER
OR
DEATH
AND
TO
INDUCE
ME
TO
COMMENCE
THIS
LABOURIOUS
VOYAGE
WITH
THE
JOY
A
CHILD
FEELS
WHEN
HE
EMBARKS
IN
A
LITTLE
BOAT
WITH
HIS
HOLIDAY
MATES
ON
AN
EXPEDITION
OF
DISCOVERY
UP
HIS
NATIVE
RIVER
BUT
SUPPOSING
ALL
THESE
CONJECTURES
TO
BE
FALSE
YOU
CANNOT
CONTEST
THE
INESTIMABLE
BENEFIT
WHICH
I
SHALL
CONFER
ON
ALL
MANKIND
TO
THE
LAST
GENERATION
BY
DISCOVERING
A
PASSAGE
NEAR
THE
POLE
TO
THOSE
COUNTRIES
TO
REACH
WHICH
AT
PRESENT
SO
MANY
MONTHS
ARE
REQUISITE
OR
BY
ASCERTAINING
THE
SECRET
OF
THE
MAGNET
WHICH
IF
AT
ALL
POSSIBLE
CAN
ONLY
BE
EFFECTED
BY
AN
UNDERTAKING
SUCH
AS
MINE
THESE
REFLECTIONS
HAVE
DISPELLED
THE
AGITATION
WITH
WHICH
I
BEGAN
MY
LETTER
AND
I
FEEL
MY
HEART
GLOW
WITH
AN
ENTHUSIASM
WHICH
ELEVATES
ME
TO
HEAVEN
FOR
NOTHING
CONTRIBUTES
SO
MUCH
TO
TRANQUILLIZE
THE
MIND
AS
A
STEADY
PURPOSEA
POINT
ON
WHICH
THE
SOUL
MAY
FIX
ITS
INTELLECTUAL
EYE
THIS
EXPEDITION
HAS
BEEN
THE
FAVOURITE
DREAM
OF
MY
EARLY
YEARS
I
HAVE
READ
WITH
ARDOUR
THE
ACCOUNTS
OF
THE
VARIOUS
VOYAGES
WHICH
HAVE
BEEN
MADE
IN
THE
PROSPECT
OF
ARRIVING
AT
THE
NORTH
PACIFIC
OCEAN
THROUGH
THE
SEAS
WHICH
SURROUND
THE
POLE
YOU
MAY
REMEMBER
THAT
A
HISTORY
OF
ALL
THE
VOYAGES
MADE
FOR
PURPOSES
OF
DISCOVERY
COMPOSED
THE
WHOLE
OF
OUR
GOOD
UNCLE
THOMAS
LIBRARY
MY
EDUCATION
WAS
NEGLECTED
YET
I
WAS
PASSIONATELY
FOND
OF
READING
THESE
VOLUMES
WERE
MY
STUDY
DAY
AND
NIGHT
AND
MY
FAMILIARITY
WITH
THEM
INCREASED
THAT
REGRET
WHICH
I
HAD
FELT
AS
A
CHILD
ON
LEARNING
THAT
MY
FATHERS
DYING
INJUNCTION
HAD
FORBIDDEN
MY
UNCLE
TO
ALLOW
ME
TO
EMBARK
IN
A
SEAFARING
LIFE
THESE
VISIONS
FADED
WHEN
I
PERUSED
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
THOSE
POETS
WHOSE
EFFUSIONS
ENTRANCED
MY
SOUL
AND
LIFTED
IT
TO
HEAVEN
I
ALSO
BECAME
A
POET
AND
FOR
ONE
YEAR
LIVED
IN
A
PARADISE
OF
MY
OWN
CREATION
I
IMAGINED
THAT
I
ALSO
MIGHT
OBTAIN
A
NICHE
IN
THE
TEMPLE
WHERE
THE
NAMES
OF
HOMER
AND
SHAKESPEARE
ARE
CONSECRATED
YOU
ARE
WELL
ACQUAINTED
WITH
MY
FAILURE
AND
HOW
HEAVILY
I
BORE
THE
DISAPPOINTMENT
BUT
JUST
AT
THAT
TIME
I
INHERITED
THE
FORTUNE
OF
MY
COUSIN
AND
MY
THOUGHTS
WERE
TURNED
INTO
THE
CHANNEL
OF
THEIR
EARLIER
BENT
SIX
YEARS
HAVE
PASSED
SINCE
I
RESOLVED
ON
MY
PRESENT
UNDERTAKING
I
CAN
EVEN
NOW
REMEMBER
THE
HOUR
FROM
WHICH
I
DEDICATED
MYSELF
TO
THIS
GREAT
ENTERPRISE
I
COMMENCED
BY
INURING
MY
BODY
TO
HARDSHIP
I
ACCOMPANIED
THE
WHALEFISHERS
ON
SEVERAL
EXPEDITIONS
TO
THE
NORTH
SEA
I
VOLUNTARILY
ENDURED
COLD
FAMINE
THIRST
AND
WANT
OF
SLEEP
I
OFTEN
WORKED
HARDER
THAN
THE
COMMON
SAILORS
DURING
THE
DAY
AND
DEVOTED
MY
NIGHTS
TO
THE
STUDY
OF
MATHEMATICS
THE
THEORY
OF
MEDICINE
AND
THOSE
BRANCHES
OF
PHYSICAL
SCIENCE
FROM
WHICH
A
NAVAL
ADVENTURER
MIGHT
DERIVE
THE
GREATEST
PRACTICAL
ADVANTAGE
TWICE
I
ACTUALLY
HIRED
MYSELF
AS
AN
UNDERMATE
IN
A
GREENLAND
WHALER
AND
ACQUITTED
MYSELF
TO
ADMIRATION
I
MUST
OWN
I
FELT
A
LITTLE
PROUD
WHEN
MY
CAPTAIN
OFFERED
ME
THE
SECOND
DIGNITY
IN
THE
VESSEL
AND
ENTREATED
ME
TO
REMAIN
WITH
THE
GREATEST
EARNESTNESS
SO
VALUABLE
DID
HE
CONSIDER
MY
SERVICES
AND
NOW
DEAR
MARGARET
DO
I
NOT
DESERVE
TO
ACCOMPLISH
SOME
GREAT
PURPOSE
MY
LIFE
MIGHT
HAVE
BEEN
PASSED
IN
EASE
AND
LUXURY
BUT
I
PREFERRED
GLORY
TO
EVERY
ENTICEMENT
THAT
WEALTH
PLACED
IN
MY
PATH
OH
THAT
SOME
ENCOURAGING
VOICE
WOULD
ANSWER
IN
THE
AFFIRMATIVE!
MY
COURAGE
AND
MY
RESOLUTION
IS
FIRM
BUT
MY
HOPES
FLUCTUATE
AND
MY
SPIRITS
ARE
OFTEN
DEPRESSED
I
AM
ABOUT
TO
PROCEED
ON
A
LONG
AND
DIFFICULT
VOYAGE
THE
EMERGENCIES
OF
WHICH
WILL
DEMAND
ALL
MY
FORTITUDE:
I
AM
REQUIRED
NOT
ONLY
TO
RAISE
THE
SPIRITS
OF
OTHERS
BUT
SOMETIMES
TO
SUSTAIN
MY
OWN
WHEN
THEIRS
ARE
FAILING
THIS
IS
THE
MOST
FAVOURABLE
PERIOD
FOR
TRAVELLING
IN
RUSSIA
THEY
FLY
QUICKLY
OVER
THE
SNOW
IN
THEIR
SLEDGES
THE
MOTION
IS
PLEASANT
AND
IN
MY
OPINION
FAR
MORE
AGREEABLE
THAN
THAT
OF
AN
ENGLISH
STAGECOACH
THE
COLD
IS
NOT
EXCESSIVE
IF
YOU
ARE
WRAPPED
IN
FURSA
DRESS
WHICH
I
HAVE
ALREADY
ADOPTED
FOR
THERE
IS
A
GREAT
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
WALKING
THE
DECK
AND
REMAINING
SEATED
MOTIONLESS
FOR
HOURS
WHEN
NO
EXERCISE
PREVENTS
THE
BLOOD
FROM
ACTUALLY
FREEZING
IN
YOUR
VEINS
I
HAVE
NO
AMBITION
TO
LOSE
MY
LIFE
ON
THE
POSTROAD
BETWEEN
ST
PETERSBURGH
AND
ARCHANGEL
I
SHALL
DEPART
FOR
THE
LATTER
TOWN
IN
A
FORTNIGHT
OR
THREE
WEEKS
AND
MY
INTENTION
IS
TO
HIRE
A
SHIP
THERE
WHICH
CAN
EASILY
BE
DONE
BY
PAYING
THE
INSURANCE
FOR
THE
OWNER
AND
TO
ENGAGE
AS
MANY
SAILORS
AS
I
THINK
NECESSARY
AMONG
THOSE
WHO
ARE
ACCUSTOMED
TO
THE
WHALEFISHING
I
DO
NOT
INTEND
TO
SAIL
UNTIL
THE
MONTH
OF
JUNE
AND
WHEN
SHALL
I
RETURN
AH
DEAR
SISTER
HOW
CAN
I
ANSWER
THIS
QUESTION
IF
I
SUCCEED
MANY
MANY
MONTHS
PERHAPS
YEARS
WILL
PASS
BEFORE
YOU
AND
I
MAY
MEET
IF
I
FAIL
YOU
WILL
SEE
ME
AGAIN
SOON
OR
NEVER
FAREWELL
MY
DEAR
EXCELLENT
MARGARET
HEAVEN
SHOWER
DOWN
BLESSINGS
ON
YOU
AND
SAVE
ME
THAT
I
MAY
AGAIN
AND
AGAIN
TESTIFY
MY
GRATITUDE
FOR
ALL
YOUR
LOVE
AND
KINDNESS
YOUR
AFFECTIONATE
BROTHER

ARCHANGEL
28TH
MARCH
17
HOW
SLOWLY
THE
TIME
PASSES
HERE
ENCOMPASSED
AS
I
AM
BY
FROST
AND
SNOW!
YET
A
SECOND
STEP
IS
TAKEN
TOWARDS
MY
ENTERPRISE
I
HAVE
HIRED
A
VESSEL
AND
AM
OCCUPIED
IN
COLLECTING
MY
SAILORS
THOSE
WHOM
I
HAVE
ALREADY
ENGAGED
APPEAR
TO
BE
MEN
ON
WHOM
I
CAN
DEPEND
AND
ARE
CERTAINLY
POSSESSED
OF
DAUNTLESS
COURAGE
BUT
I
HAVE
ONE
WANT
WHICH
I
HAVE
NEVER
YET
BEEN
ABLE
TO
SATISFY
AND
THE
ABSENCE
OF
THE
OBJECT
OF
WHICH
I
NOW
FEEL
AS
A
MOST
SEVERE
EVIL
I
HAVE
NO
FRIEND
MARGARET:
WHEN
I
AM
GLOWING
WITH
THE
ENTHUSIASM
OF
SUCCESS
THERE
WILL
BE
NONE
TO
PARTICIPATE
MY
JOY
IF
I
AM
ASSAILED
BY
DISAPPOINTMENT
NO
ONE
WILL
ENDEAVOUR
TO
SUSTAIN
ME
IN
DEJECTION
I
SHALL
COMMIT
MY
THOUGHTS
TO
PAPER
IT
IS
TRUE
BUT
THAT
IS
A
POOR
MEDIUM
FOR
THE
COMMUNICATION
OF
FEELING
I
DESIRE
THE
COMPANY
OF
A
MAN
WHO
COULD
SYMPATHIZE
WITH
ME
WHOSE
EYES
WOULD
REPLY
TO
MINE
YOU
MAY
DEEM
ME
ROMANTIC
MY
DEAR
SISTER
BUT
I
BITTERLY
FEEL
THE
WANT
OF
A
FRIEND
I
HAVE
NO
ONE
NEAR
ME
GENTLE
YET
COURAGEOUS
POSSESSED
OF
A
CULTIVATED
AS
WELL
AS
OF
A
CAPACIOUS
MIND
WHOSE
TASTES
ARE
LIKE
MY
OWN
TO
APPROVE
OR
AMEND
MY
PLANS
HOW
WOULD
SUCH
A
FRIEND
REPAIR
THE
FAULTS
OF
YOUR
POOR
BROTHER!
I
AM
TOO
ARDENT
IN
EXECUTION
AND
TOO
IMPATIENT
OF
DIFFICULTIES
BUT
IT
IS
A
STILL
GREATER
EVIL
TO
ME
THAT
I
AM
SELFEDUCATED:
FOR
THE
FIRST
FOURTEEN
YEARS
OF
MY
LIFE
I
RAN
WILD
ON
A
COMMON
AND
READ
NOTHING
BUT
OUR
UNCLE
THOMAS
BOOKS
OF
VOYAGES
AT
THAT
AGE
I
BECAME
ACQUAINTED
WITH
THE
CELEBRATED
POETS
OF
OUR
OWN
COUNTRY
BUT
IT
WAS
ONLY
WHEN
IT
HAD
CEASED
TO
BE
IN
MY
POWER
TO
DERIVE
ITS
MOST
IMPORTANT
BENEFITS
FROM
SUCH
A
CONVICTION
THAT
I
PERCEIVED
THE
NECESSITY
OF
BECOMING
ACQUAINTED
WITH
MORE
LANGUAGES
THAN
THAT
OF
MY
NATIVE
COUNTRY
NOW
I
AM
TWENTYEIGHT
AND
AM
IN
REALITY
MORE
ILLITERATE
THAN
MANY
SCHOOLBOYS
OF
FIFTEEN
IT
IS
TRUE
THAT
I
HAVE
THOUGHT
MORE
AND
THAT
MY
DAYDREAMS
ARE
MORE
EXTENDED
AND
MAGNIFICENT
BUT
THEY
WANT
(AS
THE
PAINTERS
CALL
IT)
*KEEPING*
AND
I
GREATLY
NEED
A
FRIEND
WHO
WOULD
HAVE
SENSE
ENOUGH
NOT
TO
DESPISE
ME
AS
ROMANTIC
AND
AFFECTION
ENOUGH
FOR
ME
TO
ENDEAVOUR
TO
REGULATE
MY
MIND
WELL
THESE
ARE
USELESS
COMPLAINTS
I
SHALL
CERTAINLY
FIND
NO
FRIEND
ON
THE
WIDE
OCEAN
NOR
EVEN
HERE
IN
ARCHANGEL
AMONG
MERCHANTS
AND
SEAMEN
YET
SOME
FEELINGS
UNALLIED
TO
THE
DROSS
OF
HUMAN
NATURE
BEAT
EVEN
IN
THESE
RUGGED
BOSOMS
MY
LIEUTENANT
FOR
INSTANCE
IS
A
MAN
OF
WONDERFUL
COURAGE
AND
ENTERPRISE
HE
IS
MADLY
DESIROUS
OF
GLORY
OR
RATHER
TO
WORD
MY
PHRASE
MORE
CHARACTERISTICALLY
OF
ADVANCEMENT
IN
HIS
PROFESSION
HE
IS
AN
ENGLISHMAN
AND
IN
THE
MIDST
OF
NATIONAL
AND
PROFESSIONAL
PREJUDICES
UNSOFTENED
BY
CULTIVATION
RETAINS
SOME
OF
THE
NOBLEST
ENDOWMENTS
OF
HUMANITY
I
FIRST
BECAME
ACQUAINTED
WITH
HIM
ON
BOARD
A
WHALE
VESSEL
FINDING
THAT
HE
WAS
UNEMPLOYED
IN
THIS
CITY
I
EASILY
ENGAGED
HIM
TO
ASSIST
IN
MY
ENTERPRISE
THE
MASTER
IS
A
PERSON
OF
AN
EXCELLENT
DISPOSITION
AND
IS
REMARKABLE
IN
THE
SHIP
FOR
HIS
GENTLENESS
AND
THE
MILDNESS
OF
HIS
DISCIPLINE
THIS
CIRCUMSTANCE
ADDED
TO
HIS
WELLKNOWN
INTEGRITY
AND
DAUNTLESS
COURAGE
MADE
ME
VERY
DESIROUS
TO
ENGAGE
HIM
A
YOUTH
PASSED
IN
SOLITUDE
MY
BEST
YEARS
SPENT
UNDER
YOUR
GENTLE
AND
FEMININE
FOSTERAGE
HAS
SO
REFINED
THE
GROUNDWORK
OF
MY
CHARACTER
THAT
I
CANNOT
OVERCOME
AN
INTENSE
DISTASTE
TO
THE
USUAL
BRUTALITY
EXERCISED
ON
BOARD
SHIP:
I
HAVE
NEVER
BELIEVED
IT
TO
BE
NECESSARY
AND
WHEN
I
HEARD
OF
A
MARINER
EQUALLY
NOTED
FOR
HIS
KINDLINESS
OF
HEART
AND
THE
RESPECT
AND
OBEDIENCE
PAID
TO
HIM
BY
HIS
CREW
I
FELT
MYSELF
PECULIARLY
FORTUNATE
IN
BEING
ABLE
TO
SECURE
HIS
SERVICES
I
HEARD
OF
HIM
FIRST
IN
RATHER
A
ROMANTIC
MANNER
FROM
A
LADY
WHO
OWES
TO
HIM
THE
HAPPINESS
OF
HER
LIFE
THIS
BRIEFLY
IS
HIS
STORY
SOME
YEARS
AGO
HE
LOVED
A
YOUNG
RUSSIAN
LADY
OF
MODERATE
FORTUNE
AND
HAVING
AMASSED
A
CONSIDERABLE
SUM
IN
PRIZEMONEY
THE
FATHER
OF
THE
GIRL
CONSENTED
TO
THE
MATCH
HE
SAW
HIS
MISTRESS
ONCE
BEFORE
THE
DESTINED
CEREMONY
BUT
SHE
WAS
BATHED
IN
TEARS
AND
THROWING
HERSELF
AT
HIS
FEET
ENTREATED
HIM
TO
SPARE
HER
CONFESSING
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
THAT
SHE
LOVED
ANOTHER
BUT
THAT
HE
WAS
POOR
AND
THAT
HER
FATHER
WOULD
NEVER
CONSENT
TO
THE
UNION
MY
GENEROUS
FRIEND
REASSURED
THE
SUPPLIANT
AND
ON
BEING
INFORMED
OF
THE
NAME
OF
HER
LOVER
INSTANTLY
ABANDONED
HIS
PURSUIT
HE
HAD
ALREADY
BOUGHT
A
FARM
WITH
HIS
MONEY
ON
WHICH
HE
HAD
DESIGNED
TO
PASS
THE
REMAINDER
OF
HIS
LIFE
BUT
HE
BESTOWED
THE
WHOLE
ON
HIS
RIVAL
TOGETHER
WITH
THE
REMAINS
OF
HIS
PRIZEMONEY
TO
PURCHASE
STOCK
AND
THEN
HIMSELF
SOLICITED
THE
YOUNG
WOMANS
FATHER
TO
CONSENT
TO
HER
MARRIAGE
WITH
HER
LOVER
BUT
THE
OLD
MAN
DECIDEDLY
REFUSED
THINKING
HIMSELF
BOUND
IN
HONOUR
TO
MY
FRIEND
WHO
WHEN
HE
FOUND
THE
FATHER
INEXORABLE
QUITTED
HIS
COUNTRY
NOR
RETURNED
UNTIL
HE
HEARD
THAT
HIS
FORMER
MISTRESS
WAS
MARRIED
ACCORDING
TO
HER
INCLINATIONS
WHAT
A
NOBLE
FELLOW!
YOU
WILL
EXCLAIM
HE
IS
SO
BUT
THEN
HE
IS
WHOLLY
UNEDUCATED:
HE
IS
AS
SILENT
AS
A
TURK
AND
A
KIND
OF
IGNORANT
CARELESSNESS
ATTENDS
HIM
WHICH
WHILE
IT
RENDERS
HIS
CONDUCT
THE
MORE
ASTONISHING
DETRACTS
FROM
THE
INTEREST
AND
SYMPATHY
WHICH
OTHERWISE
HE
WOULD
COMMAND
YET
DO
NOT
SUPPOSE
BECAUSE
I
COMPLAIN
A
LITTLE
OR
BECAUSE
I
CAN
CONCEIVE
A
CONSOLATION
FOR
MY
TOILS
WHICH
I
MAY
NEVER
KNOW
THAT
I
AM
WAVERING
IN
MY
RESOLUTIONS
THOSE
ARE
AS
FIXED
AS
FATE
AND
MY
VOYAGE
IS
ONLY
NOW
DELAYED
UNTIL
THE
WEATHER
SHALL
PERMIT
MY
EMBARKATION
THE
WINTER
HAS
BEEN
DREADFULLY
SEVERE
BUT
THE
SPRING
PROMISES
WELL
AND
IT
IS
CONSIDERED
AS
A
REMARKABLY
EARLY
SEASON
SO
THAT
PERHAPS
I
MAY
SAIL
SOONER
THAN
I
EXPECTED
I
SHALL
DO
NOTHING
RASHLY:
YOU
KNOW
ME
SUFFICIENTLY
TO
CONFIDE
IN
MY
PRUDENCE
AND
CONSIDERATENESS
WHENEVER
THE
SAFETY
OF
OTHERS
IS
COMMITTED
TO
MY
CARE
I
CANNOT
DESCRIBE
TO
YOU
MY
SENSATIONS
ON
THE
NEAR
PROSPECT
OF
MY
UNDERTAKING
IT
IS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
COMMUNICATE
TO
YOU
A
CONCEPTION
OF
THE
TREMBLING
SENSATION
HALF
PLEASURABLE
AND
HALF
FEARFUL
WITH
WHICH
I
AM
PREPARING
TO
DEPART
I
AM
GOING
TO
UNEXPLORED
REGIONS
TO
THE
LAND
OF
MIST
AND
SNOW
BUT
I
SHALL
KILL
NO
ALBATROSS
THEREFORE
DO
NOT
BE
ALARMED
FOR
MY
SAFETY
OR
IF
I
SHOULD
COME
BACK
TO
YOU
AS
WORN
AND
WOEFUL
AS
THE
ANCIENT
MARINER
YOU
WILL
SMILE
AT
MY
ALLUSION
BUT
I
WILL
DISCLOSE
A
SECRET
I
HAVE
OFTEN
ATTRIBUTED
MY
ATTACHMENT
TO
MY
PASSIONATE
ENTHUSIASM
FOR
THE
DANGEROUS
MYSTERIES
OF
OCEAN
TO
THAT
PRODUCTION
OF
THE
MOST
IMAGINATIVE
OF
MODERN
POETS
THERE
IS
SOMETHING
AT
WORK
IN
MY
SOUL
WHICH
I
DO
NOT
UNDERSTAND
I
AM
PRACTICALLY
INDUSTRIOUSPAINSTAKING
A
WORKMAN
TO
EXECUTE
WITH
PERSEVERANCE
AND
LABOURBUT
BESIDES
THIS
THERE
IS
A
LOVE
FOR
THE
MARVELLOUS
A
BELIEF
IN
THE
MARVELLOUS
INTERTWINED
IN
ALL
MY
PROJECTS
WHICH
HURRIES
ME
OUT
OF
THE
COMMON
PATHWAYS
OF
MEN
EVEN
TO
THE

I
MEET
YOU
AGAIN
AFTER
HAVING
TRAVERSED
IMMENSE
SEAS
AND
RETURNED
BY
THE
MOST
SOUTHERN
CAPE
OF
AFRICA

AMERICA
I
DARE
NOT
EXPECT
SUCH
SUCCESS
YET
I
CANNOT
BEAR
TO
LOOK
ON
THE
REVERSE
OF
THE

CONTINUE
FOR
THE
PRESENT
TO
WRITE
TO
ME

I
MAY
RECEIVE

OCCASIONS

I

MOST

HASTE
TO

MY
VOYAGE
THIS

BY
A

THAN
I
WHO
MAY
NOT
SEE
MY
NATIVE
LAND
PERHAPS
FOR
MANY
YEARS
I
AM
HOWEVER
IN
GOOD
SPIRITS:
MY
MEN
ARE
BOLD
AND
APPARENTLY
FIRM
OF
PURPOSE
NOR
DO
THE
FLOATING
SHEETS
OF
ICE
THAT
CONTINUALLY
PASS
US
INDICATING
THE
DANGERS
OF
THE
REGION
TOWARDS
WHICH
WE
ARE
ADVANCING
APPEAR
TO
DISMAY
THEM
WE
HAVE
ALREADY
REACHED
A
VERY
HIGH
LATITUDE
BUT
IT
IS
THE
HEIGHT
OF
SUMMER
AND
ALTHOUGH
NOT
SO
WARM
AS
IN
ENGLAND
THE
SOUTHERN
GALES
WHICH
BLOW
US
SPEEDILY
TOWARDS
THOSE
SHORES
WHICH
I
SO
ARDENTLY
DESIRE
TO
ATTAIN
BREATHE
A
DEGREE
OF
RENOVATING
WARMTH
WHICH
I
HAD
NOT
EXPECTED
NO
INCIDENTS
HAVE
HITHERTO
BEFALLEN
US
THAT
WOULD
MAKE
A
FIGURE
IN
A
LETTER
ONE
OR
TWO
STIFF
GALES
AND
THE
SPRINGING
OF
A
LEAK
ARE
ACCIDENTS
WHICH
EXPERIENCED
NAVIGATORS
SCARCELY
REMEMBER
TO
RECORD
AND
I
SHALL
BE
WELL
CONTENT
IF
NOTHING
WORSE
HAPPEN
TO
US
DURING
OUR
VOYAGE
ADIEU
MY
DEAR
MARGARET
BE
ASSURED
THAT
FOR
MY
OWN
SAKE
AS
WELL
AS
YOURS
I
WILL
NOT
RASHLY
ENCOUNTER
DANGER
I
WILL
BE
COOL
PERSEVERING
AND
PRUDENT
BUT
SUCCESS
*SHALL*
CROWN
MY
ENDEAVOURS
WHEREFORE
NOT
THUS
FAR
I
HAVE
GONE
TRACING
A
SECURE
WAY
OVER
THE
PATHLESS
SEAS
THE
VERY
STARS
THEMSELVES
BEING
WITNESSES
AND
TESTIMONIES
OF
MY
TRIUMPH
WHY
NOT
STILL
PROCEED
OVER
THE
UNTAMED

OBEDIENT
ELEMENT
WHAT
CAN
STOP
THE
DETERMINED
HEART
AND
RESOLVED
WILL
OF
MAN
MY
SWELLING

RW
LETTER
4
TO
MRS
SAVILLE
ENGLAND
AUGUST
5TH
17
SO
STRANGE
AN
ACCIDENT
HAS
HAPPENED
TO
US
THAT
I
CANNOT
FORBEAR
RECORDING
IT
ALTHOUGH
IT
IS
VERY
PROBABLE
THAT
YOU
WILL
SEE
ME
BEFORE
THESE
PAPERS
CAN
COME
INTO
YOUR
POSSESSION
LAST
MONDAY
(JULY
31ST)
WE
WERE
NEARLY
SURROUNDED
BY
ICE
WHICH
CLOSED
IN
THE
SHIP
ON
ALL
SIDES
SCARCELY
LEAVING
HER
THE
SEAROOM
IN
WHICH
SHE
FLOATED
OUR
SITUATION
WAS
SOMEWHAT
DANGEROUS
ESPECIALLY
AS
WE
WERE
COMPASSED
ROUND
BY
A
VERY
THICK
FOG
WE
ACCORDINGLY
LAY
TO
HOPING
THAT
SOME
CHANGE
WOULD
TAKE
PLACE
IN
THE
ATMOSPHERE
AND
WEATHER
ABOUT
TWO
OCLOCK
THE
MIST
CLEARED
AWAY
AND
WE
BEHELD
STRETCHED
OUT
IN
EVERY
DIRECTION
VAST
AND
IRREGULAR
PLAINS
OF
ICE
WHICH
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
NO
END
SOME
OF
MY
COMRADES
GROANED
AND
MY
OWN
MIND
BEGAN
TO
GROW
WATCHFUL
WITH
ANXIOUS
THOUGHTS
WHEN
A
STRANGE
SIGHT
SUDDENLY
ATTRACTED
OUR
ATTENTION
AND
DIVERTED
OUR
SOLICITUDE
FROM
OUR
OWN
SITUATION
WE
PERCEIVED
A
LOW
CARRIAGE
FIXED
ON
A
SLEDGE
AND
DRAWN
BY
DOGS
PASS
ON
TOWARDS
THE
NORTH
AT
THE
DISTANCE
OF
HALF
A
MILE
A
BEING
WHICH
HAD
THE
SHAPE
OF
A
MAN
BUT
APPARENTLY
OF
GIGANTIC
STATURE
SAT
IN
THE
SLEDGE
AND
GUIDED
THE
DOGS
WE
WATCHED
THE
RAPID
PROGRESS
OF
THE
TRAVELLER
WITH
OUR
TELESCOPES
UNTIL
HE
WAS
LOST
AMONG
THE
DISTANT
INEQUALITIES
OF
THE
ICE
THIS
APPEARANCE
EXCITED
OUR
UNQUALIFIED
WONDER
WE
WERE
AS
WE
BELIEVED
MANY
HUNDRED
MILES
FROM
ANY
LAND
BUT
THIS
APPARITION
SEEMED
TO
DENOTE
THAT
IT
WAS
NOT
IN
REALITY
SO
DISTANT
AS
WE
HAD
SUPPOSED
SHUT
IN
HOWEVER
BY
ICE
IT
WAS
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
FOLLOW
HIS
TRACK
WHICH
WE
HAD
OBSERVED
WITH
THE
GREATEST
ATTENTION
ABOUT
TWO
HOURS
AFTER
THIS
OCCURRENCE
WE
HEARD
THE
GROUND
SEA
AND
BEFORE
NIGHT
THE
ICE
BROKE
AND
FREED
OUR
SHIP
WE
HOWEVER
LAY
TO
UNTIL
THE
MORNING
FEARING
TO
ENCOUNTER
IN
THE
DARK
THOSE
LARGE
LOOSE
MASSES
WHICH
FLOAT
ABOUT
AFTER
THE
BREAKING
UP
OF
THE
ICE
I
PROFITED
OF
THIS
TIME
TO
REST
FOR
A
FEW
HOURS
IN
THE
MORNING
HOWEVER
AS
SOON
AS
IT
WAS
LIGHT
I
WENT
UPON
DECK
AND
FOUND
ALL
THE
SAILORS
BUSY
ON
ONE
SIDE
OF
THE
VESSEL
APPARENTLY
TALKING
TO
SOMEONE
IN
THE
SEA
IT
WAS
IN
FACT
A
SLEDGE
LIKE
THAT
WE
HAD
SEEN
BEFORE
WHICH
HAD
DRIFTED
TOWARDS
US
IN
THE
NIGHT
ON
A
LARGE
FRAGMENT
OF
ICE
ONLY
ONE
DOG
REMAINED
ALIVE
BUT
THERE
WAS
A
HUMAN
BEING
WITHIN
IT
WHOM
THE
SAILORS
WERE
PERSUADING
TO
ENTER
THE
VESSEL
HE
WAS
NOT
AS
THE
OTHER
TRAVELLER
SEEMED
TO
BE
A
SAVAGE
INHABITANT
OF
SOME
UNDISCOVERED
ISLAND
BUT
A
EUROPEAN
WHEN
I
APPEARED
ON
DECK
THE
MASTER
SAID
HERE
IS
OUR
CAPTAIN
AND
HE
WILL
NOT
ALLOW
YOU
TO
PERISH
ON
THE
OPEN
SEA
ON
PERCEIVING
ME
THE
STRANGER
ADDRESSED
ME
IN
ENGLISH
ALTHOUGH
WITH
A
FOREIGN
ACCENT
BEFORE
I
COME
ON
BOARD
YOUR
VESSEL
SAID
HE
WILL
YOU
HAVE
THE
KINDNESS
TO
INFORM
ME
WHITHER
YOU
ARE
BOUND
YOU
MAY
CONCEIVE
MY
ASTONISHMENT
ON
HEARING
SUCH
A
QUESTION
ADDRESSED
TO
ME
FROM
A
MAN
ON
THE
BRINK
OF
DESTRUCTION
AND
TO
WHOM
I
SHOULD
HAVE
SUPPOSED
THAT
MY
VESSEL
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
A
RESOURCE
WHICH
HE
WOULD
NOT
HAVE
EXCHANGED
FOR
THE
MOST
PRECIOUS
WEALTH
THE
EARTH
CAN
AFFORD
I
REPLIED
HOWEVER
THAT
WE
WERE
ON
A
VOYAGE
OF
DISCOVERY
TOWARDS
THE
NORTHERN
POLE
UPON
HEARING
THIS
HE
APPEARED
SATISFIED
AND
CONSENTED
TO
COME
ON
BOARD
GOOD
GOD!
MARGARET
IF
YOU
HAD
SEEN
THE
MAN
WHO
THUS
CAPITULATED
FOR
HIS
SAFETY
YOUR
SURPRISE
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
BOUNDLESS
HIS
LIMBS
WERE
NEARLY
FROZEN
AND
HIS
BODY
DREADFULLY
EMACIATED
BY
FATIGUE
AND
SUFFERING
I
NEVER
SAW
A
MAN
IN
SO
WRETCHED
A
CONDITION
WE
ATTEMPTED
TO
CARRY
HIM
INTO
THE
CABIN
BUT
AS
SOON
AS
HE
HAD
QUITTED
THE
FRESH
AIR
HE
FAINTED
WE
ACCORDINGLY
BROUGHT
HIM
BACK
TO
THE
DECK
AND
RESTORED
HIM
TO
ANIMATION
BY
RUBBING
HIM
WITH
BRANDY
AND
FORCING
HIM
TO
SWALLOW
A
SMALL
QUANTITY
AS
SOON
AS
HE
SHOWED
SIGNS
OF
LIFE
WE
WRAPPED
HIM
UP
IN
BLANKETS
AND
PLACED
HIM
NEAR
THE
CHIMNEY
OF
THE
KITCHEN
STOVE
BY
SLOW
DEGREES
HE
RECOVERED
AND
ATE
A
LITTLE
SOUP
WHICH
RESTORED
HIM
WONDERFULLY
TWO
DAYS
PASSED
IN
THIS
MANNER
BEFORE
HE
WAS
ABLE
TO
SPEAK
AND
I
OFTEN
FEARED
THAT
HIS
SUFFERINGS
HAD
DEPRIVED
HIM
OF
UNDERSTANDING
WHEN
HE
HAD
IN
SOME
MEASURE
RECOVERED
I
REMOVED
HIM
TO
MY
OWN
CABIN
AND
ATTENDED
ON
HIM
AS
MUCH
AS
MY
DUTY
WOULD
PERMIT
I
NEVER
SAW
A
MORE
INTERESTING
CREATURE:
HIS
EYES
HAVE
GENERALLY
AN
EXPRESSION
OF
WILDNESS
AND
EVEN
MADNESS
BUT
THERE
ARE
MOMENTS
WHEN
IF
ANYONE
PERFORMS
AN
ACT
OF
KINDNESS
TOWARDS
HIM
OR
DOES
HIM
THE
MOST
TRIFLING
SERVICE
HIS
WHOLE
COUNTENANCE
IS
LIGHTED
UP
AS
IT
WERE
WITH
A
BEAM
OF
BENEVOLENCE
AND
SWEETNESS
THAT
I
NEVER
SAW
EQUALLED
BUT
HE
IS
GENERALLY
MELANCHOLY
AND
DESPAIRING
AND
SOMETIMES
HE
GNASHES
HIS
TEETH
AS
IF
IMPATIENT
OF
THE
WEIGHT
OF
WOES
THAT
OPPRESSES
HIM
WHEN
MY
GUEST
WAS
A
LITTLE
RECOVERED
I
HAD
GREAT
TROUBLE
TO
KEEP
OFF
THE
MEN
WHO
WISHED
TO
ASK
HIM
A
THOUSAND
QUESTIONS
BUT
I
WOULD
NOT
ALLOW
HIM
TO
BE
TORMENTED
BY
THEIR
IDLE
CURIOSITY
IN
A
STATE
OF
BODY
AND
MIND
WHOSE
RESTORATION
EVIDENTLY
DEPENDED
UPON
ENTIRE
REPOSE
ONCE
HOWEVER
THE
LIEUTENANT
ASKED
WHY
HE
HAD
COME
SO
FAR
UPON
THE
ICE
IN
SO
STRANGE
A
VEHICLE
HIS
COUNTENANCE
INSTANTLY
ASSUMED
AN
ASPECT
OF
THE
DEEPEST
GLOOM
AND
HE
REPLIED
TO
SEEK
ONE
WHO
FLED
FROM
ME
AND
DID
THE
MAN
WHOM
YOU
PURSUED
TRAVEL
IN
THE
SAME
FASHION
YES
THEN
I
FANCY
WE
HAVE
SEEN
HIM
FOR
THE
DAY
BEFORE
WE
PICKED
YOU
UP
WE
SAW
SOME
DOGS
DRAWING
A
SLEDGE
WITH
A
MAN
IN
IT
ACROSS
THE
ICE
THIS
AROUSED
THE
STRANGERS
ATTENTION
AND
HE
ASKED
A
MULTITUDE
OF
QUESTIONS
CONCERNING
THE
ROUTE
WHICH
THE
DEMON
AS
HE
CALLED
HIM
HAD
PURSUED
SOON
AFTER
WHEN
HE
WAS
ALONE
WITH
ME
HE
SAID
I
HAVE
DOUBTLESS
EXCITED
YOUR
CURIOSITY
AS
WELL
AS
THAT
OF
THESE
GOOD
PEOPLE
BUT
YOU
ARE
TOO
CONSIDERATE
TO
MAKE
INQUIRIES
CERTAINLY
IT
WOULD
INDEED
BE
VERY
IMPERTINENT
AND
INHUMAN
OF
ME
TO
TROUBLE
YOU
WITH
ANY
INQUISITIVENESS
OF
MINE
AND
YET
YOU
RESCUED
ME
FROM
A
STRANGE
AND
PERILOUS
SITUATION
YOU
HAVE
BENEVOLENTLY
RESTORED
ME
TO
LIFE
SOON
AFTER
THIS
HE
INQUIRED
IF
I
THOUGHT
THAT
THE
BREAKING
UP
OF
THE
ICE
HAD
DESTROYED
THE
OTHER
SLEDGE
I
REPLIED
THAT
I
COULD
NOT
ANSWER
WITH
ANY
DEGREE
OF
CERTAINTY
FOR
THE
ICE
HAD
NOT
BROKEN
UNTIL
NEAR
MIDNIGHT
AND
THE
TRAVELLER
MIGHT
HAVE
ARRIVED
AT
A
PLACE
OF
SAFETY
BEFORE
THAT
TIME
BUT
OF
THIS
I
COULD
NOT
JUDGE
FROM
THIS
TIME
A
NEW
SPIRIT
OF
LIFE
ANIMATED
THE
DECAYING
FRAME
OF
THE
STRANGER
HE
MANIFESTED
THE
GREATEST
EAGERNESS
TO
BE
UPON
DECK
TO
WATCH
FOR
THE
SLEDGE
WHICH
HAD
BEFORE
APPEARED
BUT
I
HAVE
PERSUADED
HIM
TO
REMAIN
IN
THE
CABIN
FOR
HE
IS
FAR
TOO
WEAK
TO
SUSTAIN
THE
RAWNESS
OF
THE
ATMOSPHERE
I
HAVE
PROMISED
THAT
SOMEONE
SHOULD
WATCH
FOR
HIM
AND
GIVE
HIM
INSTANT
NOTICE
IF
ANY
NEW
OBJECT
SHOULD
APPEAR
IN
SIGHT
SUCH
IS
MY
JOURNAL
OF
WHAT
RELATES
TO
THIS
STRANGE
OCCURRENCE
UP
TO
THE
PRESENT
DAY
THE
STRANGER
HAS
GRADUALLY
IMPROVED
IN
HEALTH
BUT
IS
VERY
SILENT
AND
APPEARS
UNEASY
WHEN
ANYONE
EXCEPT
MYSELF
ENTERS
HIS
CABIN
YET
HIS
MANNERS
ARE
SO
CONCILIATING
AND
GENTLE
THAT
THE
SAILORS
ARE
ALL
INTERESTED
IN
HIM
ALTHOUGH
THEY
HAVE
HAD
VERY
LITTLE
COMMUNICATION
WITH
HIM
FOR
MY
OWN
PART
I
BEGIN
TO
LOVE
HIM
AS
A
BROTHER
AND
HIS
CONSTANT
AND
DEEP
GRIEF
FILLS
ME
WITH
SYMPATHY
AND
COMPASSION
HE
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
A
NOBLE
CREATURE
IN
HIS
BETTER
DAYS
BEING
EVEN
NOW
IN
WRECK
SO
ATTRACTIVE
AND
AMIABLE
I
SAID
IN
ONE
OF
MY
LETTERS
MY
DEAR
MARGARET
THAT
I
SHOULD
FIND
NO
FRIEND
ON
THE
WIDE
OCEAN
YET
I
HAVE
FOUND
A
MAN
WHO
BEFORE
HIS
SPIRIT
HAD
BEEN
BROKEN
BY
MISERY
I
SHOULD
HAVE
BEEN
HAPPY
TO
HAVE
POSSESSED
AS
THE
BROTHER
OF
MY
HEART
I
SHALL
CONTINUE
MY
JOURNAL
CONCERNING
THE
STRANGER
AT
INTERVALS
SHOULD
I
HAVE
ANY
FRESH
INCIDENTS
TO
RECORD
AUGUST
13TH
17
MY
AFFECTION
FOR
MY
GUEST
INCREASES
EVERY
DAY
HE
EXCITES
AT
ONCE
MY
ADMIRATION
AND
MY
PITY
TO
AN
ASTONISHING
DEGREE
HOW
CAN
I
SEE
SO
NOBLE
A
CREATURE
DESTROYED
BY
MISERY
WITHOUT
FEELING
THE
MOST
POIGNANT
GRIEF
HE
IS
SO
GENTLE
YET
SO
WISE
HIS
MIND
IS
SO
CULTIVATED
AND
WHEN
HE
SPEAKS
ALTHOUGH
HIS
WORDS
ARE
CULLED
WITH
THE
CHOICEST
ART
YET
THEY
FLOW
WITH
RAPIDITY
AND
UNPARALLELED
ELOQUENCE
HE
IS
NOW
MUCH
RECOVERED
FROM
HIS
ILLNESS
AND
IS
CONTINUALLY
ON
THE
DECK
APPARENTLY
WATCHING
FOR
THE
SLEDGE
THAT
PRECEDED
HIS
OWN
YET
ALTHOUGH
UNHAPPY
HE
IS
NOT
SO
UTTERLY
OCCUPIED
BY
HIS
OWN
MISERY
BUT
THAT
HE
INTERESTS
HIMSELF
DEEPLY
IN
THE
PROJECTS
OF
OTHERS
HE
HAS
FREQUENTLY
CONVERSED
WITH
ME
ON
MINE
WHICH
I
HAVE
COMMUNICATED
TO
HIM
WITHOUT
DISGUISE
HE
ENTERED
ATTENTIVELY
INTO
ALL
MY
ARGUMENTS
IN
FAVOUR
OF
MY
EVENTUAL
SUCCESS
AND
INTO
EVERY
MINUTE
DETAIL
OF
THE
MEASURES
I
HAD
TAKEN
TO
SECURE
IT
I
WAS
EASILY
LED
BY
THE
SYMPATHY
WHICH
HE
EVINCED
TO
USE
THE
LANGUAGE
OF
MY
HEART
TO
GIVE
UTTERANCE
TO
THE
BURNING
ARDOUR
OF
MY
SOUL
AND
TO
SAY
WITH
ALL
THE
FERVOUR
THAT
WARMED
ME
HOW
GLADLY
I
WOULD
SACRIFICE
MY
FORTUNE
MY
EXISTENCE
MY
EVERY
HOPE
TO
THE
FURTHERANCE
OF
MY
ENTERPRISE
ONE
MANS
LIFE
OR
DEATH
WERE
BUT
A
SMALL
PRICE
TO
PAY
FOR
THE
ACQUIREMENT
OF
THE
KNOWLEDGE
WHICH
I
SOUGHT
FOR
THE
DOMINION
I
SHOULD
ACQUIRE
AND
TRANSMIT
OVER
THE
ELEMENTAL
FOES
OF
OUR
RACE
AS
I
SPOKE
A
DARK
GLOOM
SPREAD
OVER
MY
LISTENERS
COUNTENANCE
AT
FIRST
I
PERCEIVED
THAT
HE
TRIED
TO
SUPPRESS
HIS
EMOTION
HE
PLACED
HIS
HANDS
BEFORE
HIS
EYES
AND
MY
VOICE
QUIVERED
AND
FAILED
ME
AS
I
BEHELD
TEARS
TRICKLE
FAST
FROM
BETWEEN
HIS
FINGERS
A
GROAN
BURST
FROM
HIS
HEAVING
BREAST
I
PAUSED
AT
LENGTH
HE
SPOKE
IN
BROKEN
ACCENTS:
UNHAPPY
MAN!
DO
YOU
SHARE
MY
MADNESS
HAVE
YOU
DRUNK
ALSO
OF
THE
INTOXICATING
DRAUGHT
HEAR
ME
LET
ME
REVEAL
MY
TALE
AND
YOU
WILL
DASH
THE
CUP
FROM
YOUR
LIPS!
SUCH
WORDS
YOU
MAY
IMAGINE
STRONGLY
EXCITED
MY
CURIOSITY
BUT
THE
PAROXYSM
OF
GRIEF
THAT
HAD
SEIZED
THE
STRANGER
OVERCAME
HIS
WEAKENED
POWERS
AND
MANY
HOURS
OF
REPOSE
AND
TRANQUIL
CONVERSATION
WERE
NECESSARY
TO
RESTORE
HIS
COMPOSURE
HAVING
CONQUERED
THE
VIOLENCE
OF
HIS
FEELINGS
HE
APPEARED
TO
DESPISE
HIMSELF
FOR
BEING
THE
SLAVE
OF
PASSION
AND
QUELLING
THE
DARK
TYRANNY
OF
DESPAIR
HE
LED
ME
AGAIN
TO
CONVERSE
CONCERNING
MYSELF
PERSONALLY
HE
ASKED
ME
THE
HISTORY
OF
MY
EARLIER
YEARS
THE
TALE
WAS
QUICKLY
TOLD
BUT
IT
AWAKENED
VARIOUS
TRAINS
OF
REFLECTION
I
SPOKE
OF
MY
DESIRE
OF
FINDING
A
FRIEND
OF
MY
THIRST
FOR
A
MORE
INTIMATE
SYMPATHY
WITH
A
FELLOW
MIND
THAN
HAD
EVER
FALLEN
TO
MY
LOT
AND
EXPRESSED
MY
CONVICTION
THAT
A
MAN
COULD
BOAST
OF
LITTLE
HAPPINESS
WHO
DID
NOT
ENJOY
THIS
BLESSING
I
AGREE
WITH
YOU
REPLIED
THE
STRANGER
WE
ARE
UNFASHIONED
CREATURES
BUT
HALF
MADE
UP
IF
ONE
WISER
BETTER
DEARER
THAN
OURSELVESSUCH
A
FRIEND
OUGHT
TO
BEDO
NOT
LEND
HIS
AID
TO
PERFECTIONATE
OUR
WEAK
AND
FAULTY
NATURES
I
ONCE
HAD
A
FRIEND
THE
MOST
NOBLE
OF
HUMAN
CREATURES
AND
AM
ENTITLED
THEREFORE
TO
JUDGE
RESPECTING
FRIENDSHIP
YOU
HAVE
HOPE
AND
THE
WORLD
BEFORE
YOU
AND
HAVE
NO
CAUSE
FOR
DESPAIR
BUT
II
HAVE
LOST
EVERYTHING
AND
CANNOT
BEGIN
LIFE
ANEW
AS
HE
SAID
THIS
HIS
COUNTENANCE
BECAME
EXPRESSIVE
OF
A
CALM
SETTLED
GRIEF
THAT
TOUCHED
ME
TO
THE
HEART
BUT
HE
WAS
SILENT
AND
PRESENTLY
RETIRED
TO
HIS
CABIN
EVEN
BROKEN
IN
SPIRIT
AS
HE
IS
NO
ONE
CAN
FEEL
MORE
DEEPLY
THAN
HE
DOES
THE
BEAUTIES
OF
NATURE
THE
STARRY
SKY
THE
SEA
AND
EVERY
SIGHT
AFFORDED
BY
THESE
WONDERFUL
REGIONS
SEEM
STILL
TO
HAVE
THE
POWER
OF
ELEVATING
HIS
SOUL
FROM
EARTH
SUCH
A
MAN
HAS
A
DOUBLE
EXISTENCE:
HE
MAY
SUFFER
MISERY
AND
BE
OVERWHELMED
BY
DISAPPOINTMENTS
YET
WHEN
HE
HAS
RETIRED
INTO
HIMSELF
HE
WILL
BE
LIKE
A
CELESTIAL
SPIRIT
THAT
HAS
A
HALO
AROUND
HIM
WITHIN
WHOSE
CIRCLE
NO
GRIEF
OR
FOLLY
VENTURES
WILL
YOU
SMILE
AT
THE
ENTHUSIASM
I
EXPRESS
CONCERNING
THIS
DIVINE
WANDERER
YOU
WOULD
NOT
IF
YOU
SAW
HIM
YOU
HAVE
BEEN
TUTORED
AND
REFINED
BY
BOOKS
AND
RETIREMENT
FROM
THE
WORLD
AND
YOU
ARE
THEREFORE
SOMEWHAT
FASTIDIOUS
BUT
THIS
ONLY
RENDERS
YOU
THE
MORE
FIT
TO
APPRECIATE
THE
EXTRAORDINARY
MERITS
OF
THIS
WONDERFUL
MAN
SOMETIMES
I
HAVE
ENDEAVOURED
TO
DISCOVER
WHAT
QUALITY
IT
IS
WHICH
HE
POSSESSES
THAT
ELEVATES
HIM
SO
IMMEASURABLY
ABOVE
ANY
OTHER
PERSON
I
EVER
KNEW
I
BELIEVE
IT
TO
BE
AN
INTUITIVE
DISCERNMENT
A
QUICK
BUT
NEVERFAILING
POWER
OF
JUDGMENT
A
PENETRATION
INTO
THE
CAUSES
OF
THINGS
UNEQUALLED
FOR
CLEARNESS
AND
PRECISION
ADD
TO
THIS
A

YESTERDAY
THE
STRANGER
SAID
TO
ME
YOU
MAY
EASILY
PERCEIVE
CAPTAIN
WALTON
THAT
I
HAVE
SUFFERED
GREAT
AND
UNPARALLELED
MISFORTUNES
I
HAD
DETERMINED
AT
ONE
TIME
THAT
THE
MEMORY
OF
THESE
EVILS
SHOULD
DIE
WITH
ME
BUT
YOU
HAVE
WON
ME
TO
ALTER
MY
DETERMINATION
YOU
SEEK
FOR
KNOWLEDGE
AND
WISDOM
AS
I
ONCE
DID
AND
I
ARDENTLY
HOPE
THAT
THE
GRATIFICATION
OF
YOUR
WISHES
MAY
NOT
BE
A
SERPENT
TO
STING
YOU
AS
MINE
HAS
BEEN
I
DO
NOT
KNOW
THAT
THE
RELATION
OF
MY
DISASTERS
WILL
BE
USEFUL
TO
YOU
YET
WHEN
I
REFLECT
THAT
YOU
ARE
PURSUING
THE
SAME
COURSE
EXPOSING
YOURSELF
TO
THE
SAME
DANGERS
WHICH
HAVE
RENDERED
ME
WHAT
I
AM
I
IMAGINE
THAT
YOU
MAY
DEDUCE
AN
APT
MORAL
FROM
MY
TALE
ONE
THAT
MAY
DIRECT
YOU
IF
YOU
SUCCEED
IN
YOUR
UNDERTAKING
AND
CONSOLE
YOU
IN
CASE
OF
FAILURE
PREPARE
TO
HEAR
OF
OCCURRENCES
WHICH
ARE
USUALLY
DEEMED
MARVELLOUS
WERE
WE
AMONG
THE
TAMER
SCENES
OF
NATURE
I
MIGHT
FEAR
TO
ENCOUNTER
YOUR
UNBELIEF
PERHAPS
YOUR
RIDICULE
BUT
MANY
THINGS
WILL
APPEAR
POSSIBLE
IN
THESE
WILD
AND
MYSTERIOUS
REGIONS
WHICH
WOULD
PROVOKE
THE
LAUGHTER
OF
THOSE
UNACQUAINTED
WITH
THE
EVERVARIED
POWERS
OF
NATURE
NOR
CAN
I
DOUBT
BUT
THAT
MY
TALE
CONVEYS
IN
ITS
SERIES
INTERNAL
EVIDENCE
OF
THE
TRUTH
OF
THE
EVENTS
OF
WHICH
IT
IS
COMPOSED
YOU
MAY
EASILY
IMAGINE
THAT
I
WAS
MUCH
GRATIFIED
BY
THE
OFFERED
COMMUNICATION
YET
I
COULD
NOT
ENDURE
THAT
HE
SHOULD
RENEW
HIS
GRIEF
BY
A
RECITAL
OF
HIS
MISFORTUNES
I
FELT
THE
GREATEST
EAGERNESS
TO
HEAR
THE
PROMISED
NARRATIVE
PARTLY
FROM
CURIOSITY
AND
PARTLY
FROM
A
STRONG
DESIRE
TO
AMELIORATE
HIS
FATE
IF
IT
WERE
IN
MY
POWER
I
EXPRESSED
THESE
FEELINGS
IN
MY
ANSWER
I
THANK
YOU
HE
REPLIED
FOR
YOUR
SYMPATHY
BUT
IT
IS
USELESS
MY
FATE
IS
NEARLY
FULFILLED
I
WAIT
BUT
FOR
ONE
EVENT
AND
THEN
I
SHALL
REPOSE
IN
PEACE
I
UNDERSTAND
YOUR
FEELING
CONTINUED
HE
PERCEIVING
THAT
I
WISHED
TO
INTERRUPT
HIM
BUT
YOU
ARE
MISTAKEN
MY
FRIEND
IF
THUS
YOU
WILL
ALLOW
ME
TO
NAME
YOU
NOTHING
CAN
ALTER
MY
DESTINY
LISTEN
TO
MY
HISTORY
AND
YOU
WILL
PERCEIVE
HOW
IRREVOCABLY
IT
IS
DETERMINED
HE
THEN
TOLD
ME
THAT
HE
WOULD
COMMENCE
HIS
NARRATIVE
THE
NEXT
DAY
WHEN
I
SHOULD
BE
AT
LEISURE
THIS
PROMISE
DREW
FROM
ME
THE
WARMEST
THANKS
I
HAVE
RESOLVED
EVERY
NIGHT
WHEN
I
AM
NOT
IMPERATIVELY
OCCUPIED
BY
MY
DUTIES
TO
RECORD
AS
NEARLY
AS
POSSIBLE
IN
HIS
OWN
WORDS
WHAT
HE
HAS
RELATED
DURING
THE
DAY
IF
I
SHOULD
BE
ENGAGED
I
WILL
AT
LEAST
MAKE
NOTES
THIS
MANUSCRIPT
WILL
DOUBTLESS
AFFORD
YOU
THE
GREATEST
PLEASURE
BUT
TO
ME
WHO
KNOW
HIM
AND
WHO
HEAR
IT
FROM
HIS
OWN
LIPSWITH
WHAT
INTEREST
AND
SYMPATHY
SHALL
I
READ
IT
IN
SOME
FUTURE
DAY!
EVEN
NOW
AS
I
COMMENCE
MY
TASK
HIS
FULLTONED
VOICE
SWELLS
IN
MY
EARS
HIS
LUSTROUS
EYES
DWELL
ON
ME
WITH
ALL
THEIR
MELANCHOLY
SWEETNESS
I
SEE
HIS
THIN
HAND
RAISED
IN
ANIMATION
WHILE
THE
LINEAMENTS
OF
HIS
FACE
ARE
IRRADIATED
BY
THE
SOUL
WITHIN
STRANGE
AND
HARROWING
MUST
BE
HIS

EMBRACED

CHAPTER
1
I
AM
BY
BIRTH
A
GENEVESE
AND
MY
FAMILY
IS
ONE
OF
THE
MOST
DISTINGUISHED
OF
THAT
REPUBLIC
MY
ANCESTORS
HAD
BEEN
FOR
MANY
YEARS
COUNSELLORS
AND
SYNDICS
AND
MY
FATHER
HAD
FILLED
SEVERAL
PUBLIC
SITUATIONS
WITH
HONOUR
AND
REPUTATION
HE
WAS
RESPECTED
BY
ALL
WHO
KNEW
HIM
FOR
HIS
INTEGRITY
AND
INDEFATIGABLE
ATTENTION
TO
PUBLIC
BUSINESS
HE
PASSED
HIS
YOUNGER
DAYS
PERPETUALLY
OCCUPIED
BY
THE
AFFAIRS
OF
HIS
COUNTRY
A
VARIETY
OF
CIRCUMSTANCES
HAD
PREVENTED
HIS
MARRYING
EARLY
NOR
WAS
IT
UNTIL
THE
DECLINE
OF
LIFE
THAT
HE
BECAME
A
HUSBAND
AND
THE
FATHER
OF
A
FAMILY
AS
THE
CIRCUMSTANCES
OF
HIS
MARRIAGE
ILLUSTRATE
HIS
CHARACTER
I
CANNOT
REFRAIN
FROM
RELATING
THEM
ONE
OF
HIS
MOST
INTIMATE
FRIENDS
WAS
A
MERCHANT
WHO
FROM
A
FLOURISHING
STATE
FELL
THROUGH
NUMEROUS
MISCHANCES
INTO
POVERTY
THIS
MAN
WHOSE
NAME
WAS
BEAUFORT
WAS
OF
A
PROUD
AND
UNBENDING
DISPOSITION
AND
COULD
NOT
BEAR
TO
LIVE
IN
POVERTY
AND
OBLIVION
IN
THE
SAME
COUNTRY
WHERE
HE
HAD
FORMERLY
BEEN
DISTINGUISHED
FOR
HIS
RANK
AND
MAGNIFICENCE
HAVING
PAID
HIS
DEBTS
THEREFORE
IN
THE
MOST
HONOURABLE
MANNER
HE
RETREATED
WITH
HIS
DAUGHTER
TO
THE
TOWN
OF
LUCERNE
WHERE
HE
LIVED
UNKNOWN
AND
IN
WRETCHEDNESS
MY
FATHER
LOVED
BEAUFORT
WITH
THE
TRUEST
FRIENDSHIP
AND
WAS
DEEPLY
GRIEVED
BY
HIS
RETREAT
IN
THESE
UNFORTUNATE
CIRCUMSTANCES
HE
BITTERLY
DEPLORED
THE
FALSE
PRIDE
WHICH
LED
HIS
FRIEND
TO
A
CONDUCT
SO
LITTLE
WORTHY
OF
THE
AFFECTION
THAT
UNITED
THEM
HE
LOST
NO
TIME
IN
ENDEAVOURING
TO
SEEK
HIM
OUT
WITH
THE
HOPE
OF
PERSUADING
HIM
TO
BEGIN
THE
WORLD
AGAIN
THROUGH
HIS
CREDIT
AND
ASSISTANCE
BEAUFORT
HAD
TAKEN
EFFECTUAL
MEASURES
TO
CONCEAL
HIMSELF
AND
IT
WAS
TEN
MONTHS
BEFORE
MY
FATHER
DISCOVERED
HIS
ABODE
OVERJOYED
AT
THIS
DISCOVERY
HE
HASTENED
TO
THE
HOUSE
WHICH
WAS
SITUATED
IN
A
MEAN
STREET
NEAR
THE
REUSS
BUT
WHEN
HE
ENTERED
MISERY
AND
DESPAIR
ALONE
WELCOMED
HIM
BEAUFORT
HAD
SAVED
BUT
A
VERY
SMALL
SUM
OF
MONEY
FROM
THE
WRECK
OF
HIS
FORTUNES
BUT
IT
WAS
SUFFICIENT
TO
PROVIDE
HIM
WITH
SUSTENANCE
FOR
SOME
MONTHS
AND
IN
THE
MEANTIME
HE
HOPED
TO
PROCURE
SOME
RESPECTABLE
EMPLOYMENT
IN
A
MERCHANTS
HOUSE
THE
INTERVAL
WAS
CONSEQUENTLY
SPENT
IN
INACTION
HIS
GRIEF
ONLY
BECAME
MORE
DEEP
AND
RANKLING
WHEN
HE
HAD
LEISURE
FOR
REFLECTION
AND
AT
LENGTH
IT
TOOK
SO
FAST
HOLD
OF
HIS
MIND
THAT
AT
THE
END
OF
THREE
MONTHS
HE
LAY
ON
A
BED
OF
SICKNESS
INCAPABLE
OF
ANY
EXERTION
HIS
DAUGHTER
ATTENDED
HIM
WITH
THE
GREATEST
TENDERNESS
BUT
SHE
SAW
WITH
DESPAIR
THAT
THEIR
LITTLE
FUND
WAS
RAPIDLY
DECREASING
AND
THAT
THERE
WAS
NO
OTHER
PROSPECT
OF
SUPPORT
BUT
CAROLINE
BEAUFORT
POSSESSED
A
MIND
OF
AN
UNCOMMON
MOULD
AND
HER
COURAGE
ROSE
TO
SUPPORT
HER
IN
HER
ADVERSITY
SHE
PROCURED
PLAIN
WORK
SHE
PLAITED
STRAW
AND
BY
VARIOUS
MEANS
CONTRIVED
TO
EARN
A
PITTANCE
SCARCELY
SUFFICIENT
TO
SUPPORT
LIFE
SEVERAL
MONTHS
PASSED
IN
THIS
MANNER
HER
FATHER
GREW
WORSE
HER
TIME
WAS
MORE
ENTIRELY
OCCUPIED
IN
ATTENDING
HIM
HER
MEANS
OF
SUBSISTENCE
DECREASED
AND
IN
THE
TENTH
MONTH
HER
FATHER
DIED
IN
HER
ARMS
LEAVING
HER
AN
ORPHAN
AND
A
BEGGAR
THIS
LAST
BLOW
OVERCAME
HER
AND
SHE
KNELT
BY
BEAUFORTS
COFFIN
WEEPING
BITTERLY
WHEN
MY
FATHER
ENTERED
THE
CHAMBER
HE
CAME
LIKE
A
PROTECTING
SPIRIT
TO
THE
POOR
GIRL
WHO
COMMITTED
HERSELF
TO
HIS
CARE
AND
AFTER
THE
INTERMENT
OF
HIS
FRIEND
HE
CONDUCTED
HER
TO
GENEVA
AND
PLACED
HER
UNDER
THE
PROTECTION
OF
A
RELATION
TWO
YEARS
AFTER
THIS
EVENT
CAROLINE
BECAME
HIS
WIFE
THERE
WAS
A
CONSIDERABLE
DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN
THE
AGES
OF
MY
PARENTS
BUT
THIS
CIRCUMSTANCE
SEEMED
TO
UNITE
THEM
ONLY
CLOSER
IN
BONDS
OF
DEVOTED
AFFECTION
THERE
WAS
A
SENSE
OF
JUSTICE
IN
MY
FATHERS
UPRIGHT
MIND
WHICH
RENDERED
IT
NECESSARY
THAT
HE
SHOULD
APPROVE
HIGHLY
TO
LOVE
STRONGLY
PERHAPS
DURING
FORMER
YEARS
HE
HAD
SUFFERED
FROM
THE
LATEDISCOVERED
UNWORTHINESS
OF
ONE
BELOVED
AND
SO
WAS
DISPOSED
TO
SET
A
GREATER
VALUE
ON
TRIED
WORTH
THERE
WAS
A
SHOW
OF
GRATITUDE
AND
WORSHIP
IN
HIS
ATTACHMENT
TO
MY
MOTHER
DIFFERING
WHOLLY
FROM
THE
DOTING
FONDNESS
OF
AGE
FOR
IT
WAS
INSPIRED
BY
REVERENCE
FOR
HER
VIRTUES
AND
A
DESIRE
TO
BE
THE
MEANS
OF
IN
SOME
DEGREE
RECOMPENSING
HER
FOR
THE
SORROWS
SHE
HAD
ENDURED
BUT
WHICH
GAVE
INEXPRESSIBLE
GRACE
TO
HIS
BEHAVIOUR
TO
HER
EVERYTHING
WAS
MADE
TO
YIELD
TO
HER
WISHES
AND
HER
CONVENIENCE
HE
STROVE
TO
SHELTER
HER
AS
A
FAIR
EXOTIC
IS
SHELTERED
BY
THE
GARDENER
FROM
EVERY
ROUGHER
WIND
AND
TO
SURROUND
HER
WITH
ALL
THAT
COULD
TEND
TO
EXCITE
PLEASURABLE
EMOTION
IN
HER
SOFT
AND
BENEVOLENT
MIND
HER
HEALTH
AND
EVEN
THE
TRANQUILLITY
OF
HER
HITHERTO
CONSTANT
SPIRIT
HAD
BEEN
SHAKEN
BY
WHAT
SHE
HAD
GONE
THROUGH
DURING
THE
TWO
YEARS
THAT
HAD
ELAPSED
PREVIOUS
TO
THEIR
MARRIAGE
MY
FATHER
HAD
GRADUALLY
RELINQUISHED
ALL
HIS
PUBLIC
FUNCTIONS
AND
IMMEDIATELY
AFTER
THEIR
UNION
THEY
SOUGHT
THE
PLEASANT
CLIMATE
OF
ITALY
AND
THE
CHANGE
OF
SCENE
AND
INTEREST
ATTENDANT
ON
A
TOUR
THROUGH
THAT
LAND
OF
WONDERS
AS
A
RESTORATIVE
FOR
HER
WEAKENED

FROM
ITALY
THEY
VISITED
GERMANY
AND
FRANCE
I
THEIR
ELDEST
CHILD
WAS
BORN
AT
NAPLES
AND
AS
AN
INFANT
ACCOMPANIED
THEM
IN
THEIR
RAMBLES
I
REMAINED
FOR
SEVERAL
YEARS
THEIR
ONLY
CHILD
MUCH
AS
THEY
WERE
ATTACHED
TO
EACH
OTHER
THEY
SEEMED
TO
DRAW
INEXHAUSTIBLE
STORES
OF
AFFECTION
FROM
A
VERY
MINE
OF
LOVE
TO
BESTOW
THEM
UPON
ME
MY
MOTHERS
TENDER
CARESSES
AND
MY
FATHERS
SMILE
OF
BENEVOLENT
PLEASURE

REGARDING

WAS
IN

HANDS
TO
DIRECT
TO
HAPPINESS
OR
MISERY
ACCORDING
AS
THEY
FULFILLED
THEIR
DUTIES
TOWARDS
ME
WITH
THIS
DEEP
CONSCIOUSNESS
OF
WHAT
THEY
OWED
TOWARDS
THE
BEING
TO
WHICH
THEY
HAD
GIVEN
LIFE
ADDED
TO
THE
ACTIVE
SPIRIT
OF
TENDERNESS
THAT
ANIMATED
BOTH
IT
MAY
BE
IMAGINED
THAT
WHILE
DURING
EVERY
HOUR
OF
MY
INFANT
LIFE
I
RECEIVED
A
LESSON
OF
PATIENCE
OF
CHARITY
AND
OF
SELFCONTROL
I
WAS
SO
GUIDED
BY
A
SILKEN
CORD
THAT
ALL
SEEMED
BUT
ONE
TRAIN
OF
ENJOYMENT
TO
ME
FOR
A
LONG
TIME
I
WAS
THEIR
ONLY
CARE
MY
MOTHER
HAD
MUCH
DESIRED
TO
HAVE
A
DAUGHTER
BUT
I
CONTINUED
THEIR
SINGLE
OFFSPRING
WHEN
I
WAS
ABOUT
FIVE
YEARS
OLD
WHILE
MAKING
AN
EXCURSION
BEYOND
THE
FRONTIERS
OF
ITALY
THEY
PASSED
A
WEEK
ON
THE
SHORES
OF
THE
LAKE
OF
COMO
THEIR
BENEVOLENT
DISPOSITION
OFTEN
MADE
THEM
ENTER
THE
COTTAGES
OF
THE
POOR
THIS
TO
MY
MOTHER
WAS
MORE
THAN
A
DUTY
IT
WAS
A
NECESSITY
A
PASSIONREMEMBERING
WHAT
SHE
HAD
SUFFERED
AND
HOW
SHE
HAD
BEEN
RELIEVEDFOR
HER
TO
ACT
IN
HER

THE
GUARDIAN
ANGEL
TO
THE
AFFLICTED
DURING
ONE
OF
THEIR
WALKS
A
POOR
COT
IN
THE
FOLDINGS
OF
A
VALE
ATTRACTED
THEIR
NOTICE
AS
BEING
SINGULARLY
DISCONSOLATE
WHILE
THE
NUMBER
OF
HALFCLOTHED
CHILDREN
GATHERED
ABOUT
IT
SPOKE
OF
PENURY
IN
ITS
WORST
SHAPE
ONE
DAY
WHEN
MY
FATHER
HAD
GONE
BY
HIMSELF
TO
MILAN
MY
MOTHER
ACCOMPANIED
BY
ME
VISITED
THIS
ABODE
SHE
FOUND
A
PEASANT
AND
HIS
WIFE
HARD
WORKING
BENT
DOWN
BY
CARE
AND
LABOUR
DISTRIBUTING
A
SCANTY
MEAL
TO
FIVE
HUNGRY
BABES
AMONG
THESE
THERE
WAS
ONE
WHICH
ATTRACTED
MY
MOTHER
FAR
ABOVE
ALL
THE
REST
SHE
APPEARED
OF
A
DIFFERENT
STOCK
THE
FOUR
OTHERS
WERE
DARKEYED
HARDY
LITTLE
VAGRANTS
THIS
CHILD
WAS
THIN
AND
VERY
FAIR
HER
HAIR
WAS
THE
BRIGHTEST
LIVING
GOLD
AND
DESPITE
THE
POVERTY
OF
HER
CLOTHING
SEEMED
TO
SET
A
CROWN
OF
DISTINCTION
ON
HER
HEAD
HER
BROW
WAS
CLEAR
AND
AMPLE
HER
BLUE
EYES
CLOUDLESS
AND
HER
LIPS
AND
THE
MOULDING
OF
HER
FACE
SO
EXPRESSIVE
OF
SENSIBILITY
AND
SWEETNESS
THAT
NONE
COULD
BEHOLD
HER
WITHOUT
LOOKING
ON
HER
AS
OF
A
DISTINCT
SPECIES
A
BEING
HEAVENSENT
AND
BEARING
A
CELESTIAL
STAMP
IN
ALL
HER
FEATURES
THE
PEASANT
WOMAN
PERCEIVING
THAT
MY
MOTHER
FIXED
EYES
OF
WONDER
AND
ADMIRATION
ON
THIS
LOVELY
GIRL
EAGERLY
COMMUNICATED
HER
HISTORY
SHE
WAS
NOT
HER
CHILD
BUT
THE
DAUGHTER
OF
A
MILANESE
NOBLEMAN
HER
MOTHER
WAS
A
GERMAN
AND
HAD
DIED
ON
GIVING
HER
BIRTH
THE
INFANT
HAD
BEEN
PLACED
WITH
THESE
GOOD
PEOPLE
TO
NURSE:
THEY
WERE
BETTER
OFF
THEN
THEY
HAD
NOT
BEEN
LONG
MARRIED
AND
THEIR
ELDEST
CHILD
WAS
BUT
JUST
BORN
THE
FATHER
OF
THEIR
CHARGE
WAS
ONE
OF
THOSE
ITALIANS
NURSED
IN
THE
MEMORY
OF
THE
ANTIQUE
GLORY
OF
ITALYONE
AMONG
THE
*SCHIAVI
OGNOR
FREMENTI*
WHO
EXERTED
HIMSELF
TO
OBTAIN
THE
LIBERTY
OF
HIS
COUNTRY
HE
BECAME
THE
VICTIM
OF
ITS
WEAKNESS
WHETHER
HE
HAD
DIED
OR
STILL
LINGERED
IN
THE
DUNGEONS
OF
AUSTRIA
WAS
NOT
KNOWN
HIS
PROPERTY
WAS
CONFISCATED
HIS
CHILD
BECAME
AN
ORPHAN
AND
A
BEGGAR
SHE
CONTINUED
WITH
HER
FOSTER
PARENTS
AND
BLOOMED
IN
THEIR
RUDE
ABODE
FAIRER
THAN
A
GARDEN
ROSE
AMONG
DARKLEAVED
BRAMBLES
WHEN
MY
FATHER
RETURNED
FROM
MILAN
HE
FOUND
PLAYING
WITH
ME
IN
THE
HALL
OF
OUR
VILLA
A
CHILD
FAIRER
THAN
PICTURED
CHERUBA
CREATURE
WHO
SEEMED
TO
SHED
RADIANCE
FROM
HER
LOOKS
AND
WHOSE
FORM
AND
MOTIONS
WERE
LIGHTER
THAN
THE
CHAMOIS
OF
THE
HILLS
THE
APPARITION
WAS
SOON
EXPLAINED
WITH
HIS
PERMISSION
MY
MOTHER
PREVAILED
ON
HER
RUSTIC
GUARDIANS
TO
YIELD
THEIR
CHARGE
TO
HER
THEY
WERE
FOND
OF
THE
SWEET
ORPHAN
HER
PRESENCE
HAD
SEEMED
A
BLESSING
TO
THEM
BUT
IT
WOULD
BE
UNFAIR
TO
HER
TO
KEEP
HER
IN
POVERTY
AND
WANT
WHEN
PROVIDENCE
AFFORDED
HER
SUCH
POWERFUL
PROTECTION
THEY
CONSULTED
THEIR
VILLAGE
PRIEST
AND
THE
RESULT
WAS
THAT
ELIZABETH

BECAME
THE
INMATE
OF

HOUSEMY
MORE
THAN
SISTERTHE
BEAUTIFUL
AND
ADORED
COMPANION
OF

AND

THE
PASSIONATE
AND
ALMOST
REVERENTIAL
ATTACHMENT
WITH
WHICH
ALL
REGARDED
HER
BECAME
WHILE
I
SHARED
IT
MY
PRIDE
AND
MY
DELIGHT
ON
THE
EVENING
PREVIOUS
TO
HER
BEING
BROUGHT
TO
MY
HOME
MY
MOTHER
HAD
SAID
PLAYFULLY
I
HAVE
A
PRETTY
PRESENT
FOR
MY
VICTORTOMORROW
HE
SHALL
HAVE
IT
AND
WHEN
ON
THE
MORROW
SHE
PRESENTED
ELIZABETH
TO
ME
AS
HER
PROMISED
GIFT
I
WITH
CHILDISH
SERIOUSNESS
INTERPRETED
HER
WORDS
LITERALLY
AND
LOOKED
UPON
ELIZABETH
AS
MINEMINE
TO
PROTECT
LOVE
AND
CHERISH

WE
WERE

TOGETHER
THERE
WAS
NOT
QUITE
A

IN

I
NEED
NOT
SAY
THAT
WE
WERE
STRANGERS
TO
ANY
SPECIES
OF
DISUNION
OR

HARMONY
WAS
THE
SOUL
OF
OUR

AND
THE

SUBSISTED
IN

US
NEARER
TOGETHER
ELIZABETH
WAS
OF
A
CALMER
AND
MORE
CONCENTRATED
DISPOSITION
BUT
WITH
ALL
MY
ARDOUR
I
WAS
CAPABLE
OF
A
MORE
INTENSE
APPLICATION
AND
WAS
MORE
DEEPLY
SMITTEN
WITH
THE
THIRST
FOR
KNOWLEDGE
SHE
BUSIED
HERSELF
WITH
FOLLOWING
THE
AERIAL
CREATIONS
OF
THE
POETS
AND
IN
THE
MAJESTIC
AND
WONDROUS

WHICH
SURROUNDED

AND
SATISFIED
SPIRIT
THE
MAGNIFICENT
APPEARANCES
OF
THINGS
I
DELIGHTED
IN

THEIR

THE

WAS
TO
ME

THE

LAWS
OF

GLADNESS
AKIN

AS
THEY
WERE

TO
ME
ARE
AMONG
THE
EARLIEST
SENSATIONS
I
CAN
REMEMBER
ON
THE
BIRTH
OF
A
SECOND
SON
MY
JUNIOR
BY
SEVEN
YEARS
MY
PARENTS
GAVE
UP
ENTIRELY
THEIR
WANDERING
LIFE
AND
FIXED
THEMSELVES
IN
THEIR
NATIVE
COUNTRY
WE
POSSESSED
A
HOUSE
IN
GENEVA
AND
A
CAMPAGNE
ON
BELRIVE
THE
EASTERN
SHORE
OF
THE
LAKE
AT
THE
DISTANCE
OF
RATHER
MORE
THAN
A
LEAGUE
FROM
THE
CITY
WE
RESIDED
PRINCIPALLY
IN
THE
LATTER
AND
THE
LIVES
OF
MY
PARENTS
WERE
PASSED
IN
CONSIDERABLE
SECLUSION
IT
WAS
MY
TEMPER
TO
AVOID
A
CROWD
AND
TO
ATTACH
MYSELF
FERVENTLY
TO
A
FEW
I
WAS
INDIFFERENT
THEREFORE
TO
MY
SCHOOLFELLOWS
IN
GENERAL
BUT
I
UNITED
MYSELF
IN
THE
BONDS
OF
THE
CLOSEST
FRIENDSHIP
TO
ONE
AMONG
THEM
HENRY
CLERVAL
WAS
THE
SON
OF
A
MERCHANT
OF
GENEVA
HE
WAS
A
BOY
OF
SINGULAR
TALENT
AND
FANCY
HE
LOVED
ENTERPRISE
HARDSHIP
AND
EVEN
DANGER
FOR
ITS
OWN
SAKE
HE
WAS
DEEPLY
READ
IN
BOOKS
OF
CHIVALRY
AND
ROMANCE
HE
COMPOSED
HEROIC
SONGS
AND
BEGAN
TO
WRITE
MANY
A
TALE
OF
ENCHANTMENT
AND
KNIGHTLY
ADVENTURE
HE
TRIED
TO
MAKE
US
ACT
PLAYS
AND
TO
ENTER
INTO
MASQUERADES
IN
WHICH
THE
CHARACTERS
WERE
DRAWN
FROM
THE
HEROES
OF
RONCESVALLES
OF
THE
ROUND
TABLE
OF
KING
ARTHUR
AND
THE
CHIVALROUS
TRAIN
WHO
SHED
THEIR
BLOOD
TO
REDEEM
THE
HOLY
SEPULCHRE
FROM
THE
HANDS
OF
THE
INFIDELS
NO
HUMAN
BEING
COULD
HAVE
PASSED
A
HAPPIER
CHILDHOOD
THAN
MYSELF
MY
PARENTS
WERE
POSSESSED
BY
THE
VERY
SPIRIT
OF
KINDNESS
AND
INDULGENCE
WE
FELT
THAT
THEY
WERE
NOT
THE
TYRANTS
TO
RULE
OUR
LOT
ACCORDING
TO
THEIR
CAPRICE
BUT
THE
AGENTS
AND
CREATORS
OF
ALL
THE
MANY
DELIGHTS
WHICH
WE
ENJOYED
WHEN
I
MINGLED
WITH
OTHER
FAMILIES
I
DISTINCTLY
DISCERNED
HOW
PECULIARLY
FORTUNATE
MY
LOT
WAS
AND
GRATITUDE
ASSISTED
THE
DEVELOPMENT
OF
FILIAL
LOVE
MY
TEMPER
WAS
SOMETIMES
VIOLENT
AND
MY
PASSIONS
VEHEMENT
BUT
BY
SOME
LAW
IN
MY
TEMPERATURE
THEY
WERE
TURNED
NOT
TOWARDS
CHILDISH
PURSUITS
BUT
TO
AN
EAGER
DESIRE
TO
LEARN
AND
NOT
TO
LEARN
ALL
THINGS
INDISCRIMINATELY
I
CONFESS
THAT
NEITHER
THE
STRUCTURE
OF
LANGUAGES
NOR
THE
CODE
OF
GOVERNMENTS
NOR
THE
POLITICS
OF
VARIOUS
STATES
POSSESSED
ATTRACTIONS
FOR
ME
IT
WAS
THE
SECRETS
OF
HEAVEN
AND
EARTH
THAT
I
DESIRED
TO
LEARN
AND
WHETHER
IT
WAS
THE
OUTWARD
SUBSTANCE
OF
THINGS
OR
THE
INNER
SPIRIT
OF
NATURE
AND
THE
MYSTERIOUS
SOUL
OF
MAN
THAT
OCCUPIED
ME
STILL
MY
INQUIRIES
WERE
DIRECTED
TO
THE
METAPHYSICAL
OR
IN
ITS
HIGHEST
SENSE
THE
PHYSICAL
SECRETS
OF
THE
WORLD
MEANWHILE
CLERVAL
OCCUPIED
HIMSELF
SO
TO
SPEAK
WITH
THE
MORAL
RELATIONS
OF
THINGS
THE
BUSY
STAGE
OF
LIFE
THE
VIRTUES
OF
HEROES
AND
THE
ACTIONS
OF
MEN
WERE
HIS
THEME
AND
HIS
HOPE
AND
HIS
DREAM
WAS
TO
BECOME
ONE
AMONG
THOSE
WHOSE
NAMES
ARE
RECORDED
IN
STORY
AS
THE
GALLANT
AND
ADVENTUROUS
BENEFACTORS
OF
OUR
SPECIES
THE
SAINTLY
SOUL
OF
ELIZABETH
SHONE
LIKE
A
SHRINEDEDICATED
LAMP
IN
OUR
PEACEFUL
HOME
HER
SYMPATHY
WAS
OURS
HER
SMILE
HER
SOFT
VOICE
THE
SWEET
GLANCE
OF
HER
CELESTIAL
EYES
WERE
EVER
THERE
TO
BLESS
AND
ANIMATE
US
SHE
WAS
THE
LIVING
SPIRIT
OF
LOVE
TO
SOFTEN
AND
ATTRACT
I
MIGHT
HAVE
BECOME
SULLEN
IN
MY
STUDY
THROUGH
THE
ARDOUR
OF
MY
NATURE
BUT
THAT
SHE
WAS
THERE
TO
SUBDUE
ME
TO
A
SEMBLANCE
OF
HER
OWN
GENTLENESS
AND
CLERVALCOULD
AUGHT
ILL
ENTRENCH
ON
THE
NOBLE
SPIRIT
OF
CLERVAL
YET
HE
MIGHT
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
SO
PERFECTLY
HUMANE
SO
THOUGHTFUL
IN
HIS
GENEROSITY
SO
FULL
OF
KINDNESS
AND
TENDERNESS
AMIDST
HIS
PASSION
FOR
ADVENTUROUS
EXPLOIT
HAD
SHE
NOT
UNFOLDED
TO
HIM
THE
REAL
LOVELINESS
OF
BENEFICENCE
AND
MADE
THE
DOING
GOOD
THE
END
AND
AIM
OF
HIS
SOARING
AMBITION
I
FEEL
EXQUISITE
PLEASURE
IN
DWELLING
ON
THE
RECOLLECTIONS
OF
CHILDHOOD
BEFORE
MISFORTUNE
HAD
TAINTED
MY
MIND
AND
CHANGED
ITS
BRIGHT
VISIONS
OF
EXTENSIVE
USEFULNESS
INTO
GLOOMY
AND
NARROW
REFLECTIONS
UPON
SELF
BESIDES
IN
DRAWING
THE
PICTURE
OF
MY
EARLY
DAYS
I
ALSO
RECORD
THOSE
EVENTS
WHICH
LED
BY
INSENSIBLE
STEPS
TO
MY
AFTER
TALE
OF
MISERY
FOR
WHEN
I
WOULD
ACCOUNT
TO
MYSELF
FOR
THE
BIRTH
OF
THAT
PASSION
WHICH
AFTERWARD
RULED
MY
DESTINY
I
FIND
IT
ARISE
LIKE
A
MOUNTAIN
RIVER
FROM
IGNOBLE
AND
ALMOST
FORGOTTEN
SOURCES
BUT
SWELLING
AS
IT
PROCEEDED
IT
BECAME
THE
TORRENT
WHICH
IN
ITS
COURSE
HAS
SWEPT
AWAY
ALL
MY
HOPES
AND
JOYS
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
IS
THE
GENIUS
THAT
HAS
REGULATED
MY
FATE
I
DESIRE
THEREFORE
IN
THIS
NARRATION
TO
STATE
THOSE
FACTS
WHICH
LED
TO
MY
PREDILECTION
FOR
THAT
SCIENCE
WHEN
I
WAS
THIRTEEN
YEARS
OF
AGE
WE
ALL
WENT
ON
A
PARTY
OF
PLEASURE
TO
THE
BATHS
NEAR
THONON
THE
INCLEMENCY
OF
THE
WEATHER
OBLIGED
US
TO
REMAIN
A
DAY
CONFINED
TO
THE
INN
IN
THIS
HOUSE
I
CHANCED
TO
FIND
A
VOLUME
OF
THE
WORKS
OF
CORNELIUS
AGRIPPA
I
OPENED
IT
WITH
APATHY
THE
THEORY
WHICH
HE
ATTEMPTS
TO
DEMONSTRATE
AND
THE
WONDERFUL
FACTS
WHICH
HE
RELATES
SOON
CHANGED
THIS
FEELING
INTO
ENTHUSIASM
A
NEW
LIGHT
SEEMED
TO
DAWN
UPON
MY
MIND
AND
BOUNDING
WITH
JOY
I
COMMUNICATED
MY
DISCOVERY
TO
MY
FATHER
MY
FATHER
LOOKED
CARELESSLY
AT
THE
TITLE
PAGE
OF
MY
BOOK
AND
SAID
AH!
CORNELIUS
AGRIPPA!
MY
DEAR
VICTOR
DO
NOT
WASTE
YOUR
TIME
UPON
THIS
IT
IS
SAD
TRASH
IF
INSTEAD
OF
THIS
REMARK
MY
FATHER
HAD
TAKEN
THE
PAINS
TO
EXPLAIN
TO
ME
THAT
THE
PRINCIPLES
OF
AGRIPPA
HAD
BEEN
ENTIRELY
EXPLODED
AND
THAT
A
MODERN
SYSTEM
OF
SCIENCE
HAD
BEEN
INTRODUCED
WHICH
POSSESSED
MUCH
GREATER
POWERS
THAN
THE
ANCIENT
BECAUSE
THE
POWERS
OF
THE
LATTER
WERE
CHIMERICAL
WHILE
THOSE
OF
THE
FORMER
WERE
REAL
AND
PRACTICAL
UNDER
SUCH
CIRCUMSTANCES
I
SHOULD
CERTAINLY
HAVE
THROWN
AGRIPPA
ASIDE
AND
HAVE
CONTENTED
MY
IMAGINATION
WARMED
AS
IT
WAS
BY
RETURNING
WITH
GREATER
ARDOUR
TO
MY
FORMER
STUDIES
IT
IS
EVEN
POSSIBLE
THAT
THE
TRAIN
OF
MY
IDEAS
WOULD
NEVER
HAVE
RECEIVED
THE
FATAL
IMPULSE
THAT
LED
TO
MY
RUIN
BUT
THE
CURSORY
GLANCE
MY
FATHER
HAD
TAKEN
OF
MY
VOLUME
BY
NO
MEANS
ASSURED
ME
THAT
HE
WAS
ACQUAINTED
WITH
ITS
CONTENTS
AND
I
CONTINUED
TO
READ
WITH
THE
GREATEST
AVIDITY
WHEN
I
RETURNED
HOME
MY
FIRST
CARE
WAS
TO
PROCURE
THE
WHOLE
WORKS
OF
THIS
AUTHOR
AND
AFTERWARDS
OF
PARACELSUS
AND
ALBERTUS
MAGNUS
I
READ
AND
STUDIED
THE
WILD
FANCIES
OF
THESE
WRITERS
WITH
DELIGHT
THEY
APPEARED
TO
ME
TREASURES
KNOWN
TO
FEW
BESIDES
MYSELF
I
HAVE
DESCRIBED
MYSELF
AS
ALWAYS
HAVING
BEEN
IMBUED
WITH
A
FERVENT
LONGING
TO
PENETRATE
THE
SECRETS
OF
NATURE
IN
SPITE
OF
THE
INTENSE
LABOUR
AND
WONDERFUL
DISCOVERIES
OF
MODERN
PHILOSOPHERS
I
ALWAYS
CAME
FROM
MY
STUDIES
DISCONTENTED
AND
UNSATISFIED
SIR
ISAAC
NEWTON
IS
SAID
TO
HAVE
AVOWED
THAT
HE
FELT
LIKE
A
CHILD
PICKING
UP
SHELLS
BESIDE
THE
GREAT
AND
UNEXPLORED
OCEAN
OF
TRUTH
THOSE
OF
HIS
SUCCESSORS
IN
EACH
BRANCH
OF
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
WITH
WHOM
I
WAS
ACQUAINTED
APPEARED
EVEN
TO
MY
BOYS
APPREHENSIONS
AS
TYROS
ENGAGED
IN
THE
SAME
PURSUIT
THE
UNTAUGHT
PEASANT
BEHELD
THE
ELEMENTS
AROUND
HIM
AND
WAS
ACQUAINTED
WITH
THEIR
PRACTICAL
USES
THE
MOST
LEARNED
PHILOSOPHER
KNEW
LITTLE
MORE
HE
HAD
PARTIALLY
UNVEILED
THE
FACE
OF
NATURE
BUT
HER
IMMORTAL
LINEAMENTS
WERE
STILL
A
WONDER
AND
A
MYSTERY
HE
MIGHT
DISSECT
ANATOMIZE
AND
GIVE
NAMES
BUT
NOT
TO
SPEAK
OF
A
FINAL
CAUSE
CAUSES
IN
THEIR
SECONDARY
AND
TERTIARY
GRADES
WERE
UTTERLY
UNKNOWN
TO
HIM
I
HAD
GAZED
UPON
THE
FORTIFICATIONS
AND
IMPEDIMENTS
THAT
SEEMED
TO
KEEP
HUMAN
BEINGS
FROM
ENTERING
THE
CITADEL
OF
NATURE
AND
RASHLY
AND
IGNORANTLY
I
HAD
REPINED
BUT
HERE
WERE
BOOKS
AND
HERE
WERE
MEN
WHO
HAD
PENETRATED
DEEPER
AND
KNEW
MORE
I
TOOK
THEIR
WORD
FOR
ALL
THAT
THEY
AVERRED
AND
I
BECAME
THEIR
DISCIPLE
IT
MAY
APPEAR
STRANGE
THAT
SUCH
SHOULD
ARISE
IN
THE
EIGHTEENTH
CENTURY
BUT
WHILE
I
FOLLOWED
THE
ROUTINE
OF
EDUCATION
IN
THE
SCHOOLS
OF
GENEVA
I
WAS
TO
A
GREAT
DEGREE
SELFTAUGHT
WITH
REGARD
TO
MY
FAVOURITE
STUDIES
MY
FATHER
WAS
NOT
SCIENTIFIC
AND
I
WAS
LEFT
TO
STRUGGLE
WITH
A
CHILDS
BLINDNESS
ADDED
TO
A
STUDENTS
THIRST
FOR
KNOWLEDGE
UNDER
THE
GUIDANCE
OF
MY
NEW
PRECEPTORS
I
ENTERED
WITH
THE
GREATEST
DILIGENCE
INTO
THE
SEARCH
OF
THE
PHILOSOPHERS
STONE
AND
THE
ELIXIR
OF
LIFE
BUT
THE
LATTER
SOON
OBTAINED
MY
UNDIVIDED
ATTENTION
WEALTH
WAS
AN
INFERIOR
OBJECT
BUT
WHAT
GLORY
WOULD
ATTEND
THE
DISCOVERY
IF
I
COULD
BANISH
DISEASE
FROM
THE
HUMAN
FRAME
AND
RENDER
MAN
INVULNERABLE
TO
ANY
BUT
A
VIOLENT
DEATH!
NOR
WERE
THESE
MY
ONLY
VISIONS
THE
RAISING
OF
GHOSTS
OR
DEVILS
WAS
A
PROMISE
LIBERALLY
ACCORDED
BY
MY
FAVOURITE
AUTHORS
THE
FULFILLMENT
OF
WHICH
I
MOST
EAGERLY
SOUGHT
AND
IF
MY
INCANTATIONS
WERE
ALWAYS
UNSUCCESSFUL
I
ATTRIBUTED
THE
FAILURE
RATHER
TO
MY
OWN
INEXPERIENCE
AND
MISTAKE
THAN
TO
A
WANT
OF
SKILL
OR
FIDELITY
IN
MY
INSTRUCTORS
AND
THUS
FOR
A
TIME
I
WAS
OCCUPIED
BY
EXPLODED
SYSTEMS
MINGLING
LIKE
AN
UNADEPT
A
THOUSAND
CONTRADICTORY
THEORIES
AND
FLOUNDERING
DESPERATELY
IN
A
VERY
SLOUGH
OF
MULTIFARIOUS
KNOWLEDGE
GUIDED
BY
AN
ARDENT
IMAGINATION
AND
CHILDISH
REASONING
TILL
AN
ACCIDENT
AGAIN
CHANGED
THE
CURRENT
OF
MY
IDEAS
WHEN
I
WAS
ABOUT
FIFTEEN
YEARS
OLD
WE
HAD
RETIRED
TO
OUR
HOUSE
NEAR
BELRIVE
WHEN
WE
WITNESSED
A
MOST
VIOLENT
AND
TERRIBLE
THUNDERSTORM
IT
ADVANCED
FROM
BEHIND
THE
MOUNTAINS
OF
JURA
AND
THE
THUNDER
BURST
AT
ONCE
WITH
FRIGHTFUL
LOUDNESS
FROM
VARIOUS
QUARTERS
OF
THE
HEAVENS
I
REMAINED
WHILE
THE
STORM
LASTED
WATCHING
ITS
PROGRESS
WITH
CURIOSITY
AND
DELIGHT
AS
I
STOOD
AT
THE
DOOR
ON
A
SUDDEN
I
BEHELD
A
STREAM
OF
FIRE
ISSUE
FROM
AN
OLD
AND
BEAUTIFUL
OAK
WHICH
STOOD
ABOUT
TWENTY
YARDS
FROM
OUR
HOUSE
AND
SO
SOON
AS
THE
DAZZLING
LIGHT
VANISHED
THE
OAK
HAD
DISAPPEARED
AND
NOTHING
REMAINED
BUT
A
BLASTED
STUMP
WHEN
WE
VISITED
IT
THE
NEXT
MORNING
WE
FOUND
THE
TREE
SHATTERED
IN
A
SINGULAR
MANNER
IT
WAS
NOT
SPLINTERED
BY
THE
SHOCK
BUT
ENTIRELY
REDUCED
TO
THIN
RIBBONS
OF
WOOD
I
NEVER
BEHELD
ANYTHING
SO
UTTERLY
DESTROYED
BEFORE
THIS
I
WAS
NOT
UNACQUAINTED
WITH
THE
MORE
OBVIOUS
LAWS
OF
ELECTRICITY
ON
THIS
OCCASION
A
MAN
OF
GREAT
RESEARCH
IN
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
WAS
WITH
US
AND
EXCITED
BY
THIS
CATASTROPHE
HE
ENTERED
ON
THE
EXPLANATION
OF
A
THEORY
WHICH
HE
HAD
FORMED
ON
THE
SUBJECT
OF
ELECTRICITY
AND
GALVANISM
WHICH
WAS
AT
ONCE
NEW
AND
ASTONISHING
TO
ME
ALL
THAT
HE
SAID
THREW
GREATLY
INTO
THE
SHADE
CORNELIUS
AGRIPPA
ALBERTUS
MAGNUS
AND
PARACELSUS
THE
LORDS
OF
MY
IMAGINATION
BUT
BY
SOME
FATALITY
THE
OVERTHROW
OF
THESE
MEN
DISINCLINED
ME
TO
PURSUE
MY
ACCUSTOMED
STUDIES
IT
SEEMED
TO
ME
AS
IF
NOTHING
WOULD
OR
COULD
EVER
BE
KNOWN
ALL
THAT
HAD
SO
LONG
ENGAGED
MY
ATTENTION
SUDDENLY
GREW
DESPICABLE
BY
ONE
OF
THOSE
CAPRICES
OF
THE
MIND
WHICH
WE
ARE
PERHAPS
MOST
SUBJECT
TO
IN
EARLY
YOUTH
I
AT
ONCE
GAVE
UP
MY
FORMER
OCCUPATIONS
SET
DOWN
NATURAL
HISTORY
AND
ALL
ITS
PROGENY
AS
A
DEFORMED
AND
ABORTIVE
CREATION
AND
ENTERTAINED
THE
GREATEST
DISDAIN
FOR
A
WOULDBE
SCIENCE
WHICH
COULD
NEVER
EVEN
STEP
WITHIN
THE
THRESHOLD
OF
REAL
KNOWLEDGE
IN
THIS
MOOD
OF
MIND
I
BETOOK
MYSELF
TO
THE
MATHEMATICS
AND
THE
BRANCHES
OF
STUDY
APPERTAINING
TO
THAT
SCIENCE
AS
BEING
BUILT
UPON
SECURE
FOUNDATIONS
AND
SO
WORTHY
OF
MY
CONSIDERATION
THUS
STRANGELY
ARE
OUR
SOULS
CONSTRUCTED
AND
BY
SUCH
SLIGHT
LIGAMENTS
ARE
WE
BOUND
TO
PROSPERITY
OR
RUIN
WHEN
I
LOOK
BACK
IT
SEEMS
TO
ME
AS
IF
THIS
ALMOST
MIRACULOUS
CHANGE
OF
INCLINATION
AND
WILL
WAS
THE
IMMEDIATE
SUGGESTION
OF
THE
GUARDIAN
ANGEL
OF
MY
LIFETHE
LAST
EFFORT
MADE
BY
THE
SPIRIT
OF
PRESERVATION
TO
AVERT
THE
STORM
THAT
WAS
EVEN
THEN
HANGING
IN
THE
STARS
AND
READY
TO
ENVELOP
ME
HER
VICTORY
WAS
ANNOUNCED
BY
AN
UNUSUAL
TRANQUILLITY
AND
GLADNESS
OF
SOUL
WHICH
FOLLOWED
THE
RELINQUISHING
OF
MY
ANCIENT
AND
LATTERLY
TORMENTING
STUDIES
IT
WAS
THUS
THAT
I
WAS
TO
BE
TAUGHT
TO
ASSOCIATE
EVIL
WITH
THEIR
PROSECUTION
HAPPINESS
WITH
THEIR
DISREGARD
IT
WAS
A
STRONG
EFFORT
OF
THE
SPIRIT
OF
GOOD
BUT
IT
WAS
INEFFECTUAL
DESTINY
WAS
TOO
POTENT
AND
HER
IMMUTABLE
LAWS
HAD
DECREED
MY
UTTER
AND
TERRIBLE
DESTRUCTION
CHAPTER
3
WHEN
I
HAD
ATTAINED
THE
AGE
OF
SEVENTEEN
MY
PARENTS
RESOLVED
THAT
I
SHOULD
BECOME
A
STUDENT
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
OF
INGOLSTADT
I
HAD
HITHERTO
ATTENDED
THE
SCHOOLS
OF
GENEVA
BUT
MY
FATHER
THOUGHT
IT
NECESSARY
FOR
THE
COMPLETION
OF
MY
EDUCATION
THAT
I
SHOULD
BE
MADE
ACQUAINTED
WITH
OTHER
CUSTOMS
THAN
THOSE
OF
MY
NATIVE
COUNTRY
MY
DEPARTURE
WAS
THEREFORE
FIXED
AT
AN
EARLY
DATE
BUT
BEFORE
THE
DAY
RESOLVED
UPON
COULD
ARRIVE
THE
FIRST
MISFORTUNE
OF
MY
LIFE
OCCURREDAN
OMEN
AS
IT
WERE
OF
MY
FUTURE

ELIZABETH
HAD
CAUGHT
THE
SCARLET
FEVER
HER
ILLNESS
WAS
SEVERE
AND
SHE
WAS
IN
THE
GREATEST
DANGER
DURING
HER
ILLNESS
MANY
ARGUMENTS
HAD
BEEN
URGED
TO
PERSUADE
MY
MOTHER
TO

FROM

UPON

AT

YIELDED

THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF

WERE
FATAL
TO

ON
THE

MY

WAS
ACCOMPANIED
BY
THE

ALARMING

THE

ON

THE

SHE

MY

ALAS!
I

THAT
I
AM
TAKEN
FROM

AND
HAPPY
AND
BELOVED
AS
I
HAVE
BEEN
IS
IT
NOT
HARD
TO
QUIT
YOU
ALL
BUT
THESE
ARE
NOT
THOUGHTS
BEFITTING
ME
I
WILL
ENDEAVOUR
TO
RESIGN
MYSELF
CHEERFULLY
TO
DEATH
AND
WILL
INDULGE
A
HOPE
OF

IN
ANOTHER

SHE
DIED
CALMLY
AND

COUNTENANCE
EXPRESSED
AFFECTION
EVEN
IN

I
NEED
NOT
DESCRIBE
THE
FEELINGS
OF
THOSE
WHOSE
DEAREST
TIES
ARE
RENT
BY
THAT
MOST
IRREPARABLE
EVIL
THE
VOID
THAT
PRESENTS
ITSELF
TO
THE
SOUL
AND
THE
DESPAIR
THAT
IS
EXHIBITED
ON
THE
COUNTENANCE
IT
IS
SO
LONG
BEFORE
THE
MIND
CAN
PERSUADE
ITSELF
THAT
SHE
WHOM
WE
SAW
EVERY
DAY
AND
WHOSE
VERY
EXISTENCE
APPEARED
A
PART
OF
OUR
OWN
CAN
HAVE
DEPARTED
FOREVERTHAT
THE
BRIGHTNESS
OF
A
BELOVED
EYE
CAN
HAVE
BEEN
EXTINGUISHED
AND
THE
SOUND
OF
A
VOICE
SO
FAMILIAR
AND
DEAR
TO
THE
EAR
CAN
BE
HUSHED
NEVER
MORE
TO
BE
HEARD
THESE
ARE
THE
REFLECTIONS
OF
THE
FIRST
DAYS
BUT
WHEN
THE
LAPSE
OF
TIME
PROVES
THE
REALITY
OF
THE
EVIL
THEN
THE
ACTUAL
BITTERNESS
OF
GRIEF
COMMENCES
YET
FROM
WHOM
HAS
NOT
THAT
RUDE
HAND
RENT
AWAY
SOME
DEAR
CONNECTION
AND
WHY
SHOULD
I
DESCRIBE
A
SORROW
WHICH
ALL
HAVE
FELT
AND
MUST
FEEL
THE
TIME
AT
LENGTH
ARRIVES
WHEN
GRIEF
IS
RATHER
AN
INDULGENCE
THAN
A
NECESSITY
AND
THE
SMILE
THAT
PLAYS
UPON
THE
LIPS
ALTHOUGH
IT
MAY
BE
DEEMED
A
SACRILEGE
IS
NOT
BANISHED
MY
MOTHER
WAS
DEAD
BUT
WE
HAD
STILL
DUTIES
WHICH
WE
OUGHT
TO
PERFORM
WE
MUST
CONTINUE
OUR
COURSE
WITH
THE
REST
AND
LEARN
TO
THINK
OURSELVES
FORTUNATE
WHILST
ONE
REMAINS
WHOM
THE
SPOILER
HAS
NOT
SEIZED
MY
DEPARTURE
FOR
INGOLSTADT
WHICH
HAD
BEEN
DEFERRED
BY
THESE
EVENTS
WAS
NOW
AGAIN
DETERMINED
UPON
I
OBTAINED
FROM
MY
FATHER
A
RESPITE
OF
SOME
WEEKS
IT
APPEARED
TO
ME
SACRILEGE
SO
SOON
TO
LEAVE
THE
REPOSE
AKIN
TO
DEATH
OF
THE
HOUSE
OF
MOURNING
AND
TO
RUSH
INTO
THE
THICK
OF
LIFE
I
WAS
NEW
TO
SORROW
BUT
IT
DID
NOT
THE
LESS
ALARM
ME
I
WAS
UNWILLING
TO
QUIT
THE
SIGHT
OF
THOSE
THAT
REMAINED
TO
ME
AND
ABOVE
ALL
I
DESIRED
TO
SEE
MY
SWEET
ELIZABETH
IN
SOME
DEGREE
CONSOLED
SHE
INDEED
VEILED
HER
GRIEF
AND
STROVE
TO
ACT
THE
COMFORTER
TO
US
ALL
SHE
LOOKED
STEADILY
ON
LIFE
AND
ASSUMED
ITS
DUTIES
WITH
COURAGE
AND
ZEAL
SHE
DEVOTED
HERSELF
TO
THOSE
WHOM
SHE
HAD
BEEN
TAUGHT
TO
CALL
HER
UNCLE
AND
COUSINS
NEVER
WAS
SHE
SO
ENCHANTING
AS
AT
THIS
TIME
WHEN
SHE
RECALLED
THE
SUNSHINE
OF
HER
SMILES
AND
SPENT
THEM
UPON
US
SHE
FORGOT
EVEN
HER
OWN
REGRET
IN
HER
ENDEAVOURS
TO
MAKE
US
FORGET
THE
DAY
OF
MY
DEPARTURE
AT
LENGTH
ARRIVED
CLERVAL
SPENT
THE
LAST
EVENING
WITH
US
HE
HAD
ENDEAVOURED
TO
PERSUADE
HIS
FATHER
TO
PERMIT
HIM
TO
ACCOMPANY
ME
AND
TO
BECOME
MY
FELLOW
STUDENT
BUT
IN
VAIN
HIS
FATHER
WAS
A
NARROWMINDED
TRADER
AND
SAW
IDLENESS
AND
RUIN
IN
THE
ASPIRATIONS
AND
AMBITION
OF
HIS
SON
HENRY
DEEPLY
FELT
THE
MISFORTUNE
OF
BEING
DEBARRED
FROM
A
LIBERAL
EDUCATION
HE
SAID
LITTLE
BUT
WHEN
HE
SPOKE
I
READ
IN
HIS
KINDLING
EYE
AND
IN
HIS
ANIMATED
GLANCE
A
RESTRAINED
BUT
FIRM
RESOLVE
NOT
TO
BE
CHAINED
TO
THE
MISERABLE
DETAILS
OF
COMMERCE
WE
SAT
LATE
WE
COULD
NOT
TEAR
OURSELVES
AWAY
FROM
EACH
OTHER
NOR
PERSUADE
OURSELVES
TO
SAY
THE
WORD
FAREWELL!
IT
WAS
SAID
AND
WE
RETIRED
UNDER
THE
PRETENCE
OF
SEEKING
REPOSE
EACH
FANCYING
THAT
THE
OTHER
WAS
DECEIVED
BUT
WHEN
AT
MORNINGS
DAWN
I
DESCENDED
TO
THE
CARRIAGE
WHICH
WAS
TO
CONVEY
ME
AWAY
THEY
WERE
ALL
THEREMY
FATHER
AGAIN
TO
BLESS
ME
CLERVAL
TO
PRESS
MY
HAND
ONCE
MORE
MY
ELIZABETH
TO
RENEW
HER
ENTREATIES
THAT
I
WOULD
WRITE
OFTEN
AND
TO
BESTOW
THE
LAST
FEMININE
ATTENTIONS
ON
HER
PLAYMATE
AND
FRIEND
I
THREW
MYSELF
INTO
THE
CHAISE
THAT
WAS
TO
CONVEY
ME
AWAY
AND
INDULGED
IN
THE
MOST
MELANCHOLY
REFLECTIONS
I
WHO
HAD
EVER
BEEN
SURROUNDED
BY
AMIABLE
COMPANIONS
CONTINUALLY
ENGAGED
IN
ENDEAVOURING
TO
BESTOW
MUTUAL
PLEASUREI
WAS
NOW
ALONE
IN
THE
UNIVERSITY
WHITHER
I
WAS
GOING
I
MUST
FORM
MY
OWN
FRIENDS
AND
BE
MY
OWN
PROTECTOR
MY
LIFE
HAD
HITHERTO
BEEN
REMARKABLY
SECLUDED
AND
DOMESTIC
AND
THIS
HAD
GIVEN
ME
INVINCIBLE
REPUGNANCE
TO
NEW
COUNTENANCES
I
LOVED
MY
BROTHERS
ELIZABETH
AND
CLERVAL
THESE
WERE
OLD
FAMILIAR
FACES
BUT
I
BELIEVED
MYSELF
TOTALLY
UNFITTED
FOR
THE
COMPANY
OF
STRANGERS
SUCH
WERE
MY
REFLECTIONS
AS
I
COMMENCED
MY
JOURNEY
BUT
AS
I
PROCEEDED
MY
SPIRITS
AND
HOPES
ROSE
I
ARDENTLY
DESIRED
THE
ACQUISITION
OF
KNOWLEDGE
I
HAD
OFTEN
WHEN
AT
HOME
THOUGHT
IT
HARD
TO
REMAIN
DURING
MY
YOUTH
COOPED
UP
IN
ONE
PLACE
AND
HAD
LONGED
TO
ENTER
THE
WORLD
AND
TAKE
MY
STATION
AMONG
OTHER
HUMAN
BEINGS
NOW
MY
DESIRES
WERE
COMPLIED
WITH
AND
IT
WOULD
INDEED
HAVE
BEEN
FOLLY
TO
REPENT
I
HAD
SUFFICIENT
LEISURE
FOR
THESE
AND
MANY
OTHER
REFLECTIONS
DURING
MY
JOURNEY
TO
INGOLSTADT
WHICH
WAS
LONG
AND
FATIGUING
AT
LENGTH
THE
HIGH
WHITE
STEEPLE
OF
THE
TOWN
MET
MY
EYES
I
ALIGHTED
AND
WAS
CONDUCTED
TO
MY
SOLITARY
APARTMENT
TO
SPEND
THE
EVENING
AS
I
PLEASED
THE
NEXT
MORNING
I
DELIVERED
MY
LETTERS
OF
INTRODUCTION
AND
PAID
A
VISIT
TO
SOME
OF
THE
PRINCIPAL
PROFESSORS
CHANCEOR
RATHER
THE
EVIL
INFLUENCE
THE
ANGEL
OF
DESTRUCTION
WHICH
ASSERTED
OMNIPOTENT
SWAY
OVER
ME
FROM
THE
MOMENT
I
TURNED
MY
RELUCTANT
STEPS
FROM
MY
FATHERS
DOORLED
ME
FIRST
TO
M
KREMPE
PROFESSOR
OF
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
HE
WAS
AN
UNCOUTH
MAN
BUT
DEEPLY
IMBUED
IN
THE
SECRETS
OF
HIS
SCIENCE
HE
ASKED
ME
SEVERAL
QUESTIONS
CONCERNING
MY
PROGRESS
IN
THE
DIFFERENT
BRANCHES
OF
SCIENCE
APPERTAINING
TO
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
I
REPLIED
CARELESSLY
AND
PARTLY
IN
CONTEMPT
MENTIONED
THE
NAMES
OF
MY
ALCHEMISTS
AS
THE
PRINCIPAL
AUTHORS
I
HAD
STUDIED
THE
PROFESSOR
STARED
HAVE
YOU
HE
SAID
REALLY
SPENT
YOUR
TIME
IN
STUDYING
SUCH
NONSENSE
I
REPLIED
IN
THE
AFFIRMATIVE
EVERY
MINUTE
CONTINUED
M
KREMPE
WITH
WARMTH
EVERY
INSTANT
THAT
YOU
HAVE
WASTED
ON
THOSE
BOOKS
IS
UTTERLY
AND
ENTIRELY
LOST
YOU
HAVE
BURDENED
YOUR
MEMORY
WITH
EXPLODED
SYSTEMS
AND
USELESS
NAMES
GOOD
GOD!
IN
WHAT
DESERT
LAND
HAVE
YOU
LIVED
WHERE
NO
ONE
WAS
KIND
ENOUGH
TO
INFORM
YOU
THAT
THESE
FANCIES
WHICH
YOU
HAVE
SO
GREEDILY
IMBIBED
ARE
A
THOUSAND
YEARS
OLD
AND
AS
MUSTY
AS
THEY
ARE
ANCIENT
I
LITTLE
EXPECTED
IN
THIS
ENLIGHTENED
AND
SCIENTIFIC
AGE
TO
FIND
A
DISCIPLE
OF
ALBERTUS
MAGNUS
AND
PARACELSUS
MY
DEAR
SIR
YOU
MUST
BEGIN
YOUR
STUDIES
ENTIRELY
ANEW
SO
SAYING
HE
STEPPED
ASIDE
AND
WROTE
DOWN
A
LIST
OF
SEVERAL
BOOKS
TREATING
OF
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
WHICH
HE
DESIRED
ME
TO
PROCURE
AND
DISMISSED
ME
AFTER
MENTIONING
THAT
IN
THE
BEGINNING
OF
THE
FOLLOWING
WEEK
HE
INTENDED
TO
COMMENCE
A
COURSE
OF
LECTURES
UPON
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
IN
ITS
GENERAL
RELATIONS
AND
THAT
M
WALDMAN
A
FELLOW
PROFESSOR
WOULD
LECTURE
UPON
CHEMISTRY
THE
ALTERNATE
DAYS
THAT
HE
OMITTED
I
RETURNED
HOME
NOT
DISAPPOINTED
FOR
I
HAVE
SAID
THAT
I
HAD
LONG
CONSIDERED
THOSE
AUTHORS
USELESS
WHOM
THE
PROFESSOR
REPROBATED
BUT
I
RETURNED
NOT
AT
ALL
THE
MORE
INCLINED
TO
RECUR
TO
THESE
STUDIES
IN
ANY
SHAPE
M
KREMPE
WAS
A
LITTLE
SQUAT
MAN
WITH
A
GRUFF
VOICE
AND
A
REPULSIVE
COUNTENANCE
THE
TEACHER
THEREFORE
DID
NOT
PREPOSSESS
ME
IN
FAVOUR
OF
HIS
PURSUITS
IN
RATHER
A
TOO
PHILOSOPHICAL
AND
CONNECTED
A
STRAIN
PERHAPS
I
HAVE
GIVEN
AN
ACCOUNT
OF
THE
CONCLUSIONS
I
HAD
COME
TO
CONCERNING
THEM
IN
MY
EARLY
YEARS
AS
A
CHILD
I
HAD
NOT
BEEN
CONTENT
WITH
THE
RESULTS
PROMISED
BY
THE
MODERN
PROFESSORS
OF
NATURAL
SCIENCE
WITH
A
CONFUSION
OF
IDEAS
ONLY
TO
BE
ACCOUNTED
FOR
BY
MY
EXTREME
YOUTH
AND
MY
WANT
OF
A
GUIDE
ON
SUCH
MATTERS
I
HAD
RETROD
THE
STEPS
OF
KNOWLEDGE
ALONG
THE
PATHS
OF
TIME
AND
EXCHANGED
THE
DISCOVERIES
OF
RECENT
INQUIRERS
FOR
THE
DREAMS
OF
FORGOTTEN
ALCHEMISTS
BESIDES
I
HAD
A
CONTEMPT
FOR
THE
USES
OF
MODERN
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
IT
WAS
VERY
DIFFERENT
WHEN
THE
MASTERS
OF
THE
SCIENCE
SOUGHT
IMMORTALITY
AND
POWER
SUCH
VIEWS
ALTHOUGH
FUTILE
WERE
GRAND
BUT
NOW
THE
SCENE
WAS
CHANGED
THE
AMBITION
OF
THE
INQUIRER
SEEMED
TO
LIMIT
ITSELF
TO
THE
ANNIHILATION
OF
THOSE
VISIONS
ON
WHICH
MY
INTEREST
IN
SCIENCE
WAS
CHIEFLY
FOUNDED
I
WAS
REQUIRED
TO
EXCHANGE
CHIMERAS
OF
BOUNDLESS
GRANDEUR
FOR
REALITIES
OF
LITTLE
WORTH
SUCH
WERE
MY
REFLECTIONS
DURING
THE
FIRST
TWO
OR
THREE
DAYS
OF
MY
RESIDENCE
AT
INGOLSTADT
WHICH
WERE
CHIEFLY
SPENT
IN
BECOMING
ACQUAINTED
WITH
THE
LOCALITIES
AND
THE
PRINCIPAL
RESIDENTS
IN
MY
NEW
ABODE
BUT
AS
THE
ENSUING
WEEK
COMMENCED
I
THOUGHT
OF
THE
INFORMATION
WHICH
M
KREMPE
HAD
GIVEN
ME
CONCERNING
THE
LECTURES
AND
ALTHOUGH
I
COULD
NOT
CONSENT
TO
GO
AND
HEAR
THAT
LITTLE
CONCEITED
FELLOW
DELIVER
SENTENCES
OUT
OF
A
PULPIT
I
RECOLLECTED
WHAT
HE
HAD
SAID
OF
M
WALDMAN
WHOM
I
HAD
NEVER
SEEN
AS
HE
HAD
HITHERTO
BEEN
OUT
OF
TOWN
PARTLY
FROM
CURIOSITY
AND
PARTLY
FROM
IDLENESS
I
WENT
INTO
THE
LECTURING
ROOM
WHICH
M
WALDMAN
ENTERED
SHORTLY
AFTER
THIS
PROFESSOR
WAS
VERY
UNLIKE
HIS
COLLEAGUE
HE
APPEARED
ABOUT
FIFTY
YEARS
OF
AGE
BUT
WITH
AN
ASPECT
EXPRESSIVE
OF
THE
GREATEST
BENEVOLENCE
A
FEW
GREY
HAIRS
COVERED
HIS
TEMPLES
BUT
THOSE
AT
THE
BACK
OF
HIS
HEAD
WERE
NEARLY
BLACK
HIS
PERSON
WAS
SHORT
BUT
REMARKABLY
ERECT
AND
HIS
VOICE
THE
SWEETEST
I
HAD
EVER
HEARD
HE
BEGAN
HIS
LECTURE
BY
A
RECAPITULATION
OF
THE
HISTORY
OF
CHEMISTRY
AND
THE
VARIOUS
IMPROVEMENTS
MADE
BY
DIFFERENT
MEN
OF
LEARNING
PRONOUNCING
WITH
FERVOUR
THE
NAMES
OF
THE
MOST
DISTINGUISHED
DISCOVERERS
HE
THEN
TOOK
A
CURSORY
VIEW
OF
THE
PRESENT
STATE
OF
THE
SCIENCE
AND
EXPLAINED
MANY
OF
ITS
ELEMENTARY
TERMS
AFTER
HAVING
MADE
A
FEW
PREPARATORY
EXPERIMENTS
HE
CONCLUDED
WITH
A
PANEGYRIC
UPON
MODERN
CHEMISTRY
THE
TERMS
OF
WHICH
I
SHALL
NEVER
FORGET:
THE
ANCIENT
TEACHERS
OF
THIS
SCIENCE
SAID
HE
PROMISED
IMPOSSIBILITIES
AND
PERFORMED
NOTHING
THE
MODERN
MASTERS
PROMISE
VERY
LITTLE
THEY
KNOW
THAT
METALS
CANNOT
BE
TRANSMUTED
AND
THAT
THE
ELIXIR
OF
LIFE
IS
A
CHIMERA
BUT
THESE
PHILOSOPHERS
WHOSE
HANDS
SEEM
ONLY
MADE
TO
DABBLE
IN
DIRT
AND
THEIR
EYES
TO
PORE
OVER
THE
MICROSCOPE
OR
CRUCIBLE
HAVE
INDEED
PERFORMED
MIRACLES
THEY
PENETRATE
INTO
THE
RECESSES
OF
NATURE
AND
SHOW
HOW
SHE
WORKS
IN
HER
HIDINGPLACES
THEY
ASCEND
INTO
THE
HEAVENS
THEY
HAVE
DISCOVERED
HOW
THE
BLOOD
CIRCULATES
AND
THE
NATURE
OF
THE
AIR
WE
BREATHE
THEY
HAVE
ACQUIRED
NEW
AND
ALMOST
UNLIMITED
POWERS
THEY
CAN
COMMAND
THE
THUNDERS
OF
HEAVEN
MIMIC
THE
EARTHQUAKE
AND
EVEN
MOCK
THE
INVISIBLE
WORLD
WITH
ITS
OWN
SHADOWS
SUCH
WERE
THE
PROFESSORS
WORDSRATHER
LET
ME
SAY
SUCH
THE
WORDS
OF
THE
FATEENOUNCED
TO
DESTROY
ME
AS
HE
WENT
ON
I
FELT
AS
IF
MY
SOUL
WERE
GRAPPLING
WITH
A
PALPABLE
ENEMY
ONE
BY
ONE
THE
VARIOUS
KEYS
WERE
TOUCHED
WHICH
FORMED
THE
MECHANISM
OF
MY
BEING
CHORD
AFTER
CHORD
WAS
SOUNDED
AND
SOON
MY
MIND
WAS
FILLED
WITH
ONE
THOUGHT
ONE
CONCEPTION
ONE
PURPOSE
SO
MUCH
HAS
BEEN
DONE
EXCLAIMED
THE
SOUL
OF
FRANKENSTEINMORE
FAR
MORE
WILL
I
ACHIEVE
TREADING
IN
THE
STEPS
ALREADY
MARKED
I
WILL
PIONEER
A
NEW
WAY
EXPLORE
UNKNOWN
POWERS
AND
UNFOLD
TO
THE
WORLD
THE
DEEPEST
MYSTERIES
OF
CREATION
I
CLOSED
NOT
MY
EYES
THAT
NIGHT
MY
INTERNAL
BEING
WAS
IN
A
STATE
OF
INSURRECTION
AND
TURMOIL
I
FELT
THAT
ORDER
WOULD
THENCE
ARISE
BUT
I
HAD
NO
POWER
TO
PRODUCE
IT
BY
DEGREES
AFTER
THE
MORNINGS
DAWN
SLEEP
CAME
I
AWOKE
AND
MY
YESTERNIGHTS
THOUGHTS
WERE
AS
A
DREAM
THERE
ONLY
REMAINED
A
RESOLUTION
TO
RETURN
TO
MY
ANCIENT
STUDIES
AND
TO
DEVOTE
MYSELF
TO
A
SCIENCE
FOR
WHICH
I
BELIEVED
MYSELF
TO
POSSESS
A
NATURAL
TALENT
ON
THE
SAME
DAY
I
PAID
M
WALDMAN
A
VISIT
HIS
MANNERS
IN
PRIVATE
WERE
EVEN
MORE
MILD
AND
ATTRACTIVE
THAN
IN
PUBLIC
FOR
THERE
WAS
A
CERTAIN
DIGNITY
IN
HIS
MIEN
DURING
HIS
LECTURE
WHICH
IN
HIS
OWN
HOUSE
WAS
REPLACED
BY
THE
GREATEST
AFFABILITY
AND
KINDNESS
I
GAVE
HIM
PRETTY
NEARLY
THE
SAME
ACCOUNT
OF
MY
FORMER
PURSUITS
AS
I
HAD
GIVEN
TO
HIS
FELLOW
PROFESSOR
HE
HEARD
WITH
ATTENTION
THE
LITTLE
NARRATION
CONCERNING
MY
STUDIES
AND
SMILED
AT
THE
NAMES
OF
CORNELIUS
AGRIPPA
AND
PARACELSUS
BUT
WITHOUT
THE
CONTEMPT
THAT
M
KREMPE
HAD
EXHIBITED
HE
SAID
THAT
THESE
WERE
MEN
TO
WHOSE
INDEFATIGABLE
ZEAL
MODERN
PHILOSOPHERS
WERE
INDEBTED
FOR
MOST
OF
THE
FOUNDATIONS
OF
THEIR
KNOWLEDGE
THEY
HAD
LEFT
TO
US
AS
AN
EASIER
TASK
TO
GIVE
NEW
NAMES
AND
ARRANGE
IN
CONNECTED
CLASSIFICATIONS
THE
FACTS
WHICH
THEY
IN
A
GREAT
DEGREE
HAD
BEEN
THE
INSTRUMENTS
OF
BRINGING
TO
LIGHT
THE
LABOURS
OF
MEN
OF
GENIUS
HOWEVER
ERRONEOUSLY
DIRECTED
SCARCELY
EVER
FAIL
IN
ULTIMATELY
TURNING
TO
THE
SOLID
ADVANTAGE
OF
MANKIND
I
LISTENED
TO
HIS
STATEMENT
WHICH
WAS
DELIVERED
WITHOUT
ANY
PRESUMPTION
OR
AFFECTATION
AND
THEN
ADDED
THAT
HIS
LECTURE
HAD
REMOVED
MY
PREJUDICES
AGAINST
MODERN
CHEMISTS
I
EXPRESSED
MYSELF
IN
MEASURED
TERMS
WITH
THE
MODESTY
AND
DEFERENCE
DUE
FROM
A
YOUTH
TO
HIS
INSTRUCTOR
WITHOUT
LETTING
ESCAPE
(INEXPERIENCE
IN
LIFE
WOULD
HAVE
MADE
ME
ASHAMED)
ANY
OF
THE
ENTHUSIASM
WHICH
STIMULATED
MY
INTENDED
LABOURS
I
REQUESTED
HIS
ADVICE
CONCERNING
THE
BOOKS
I
OUGHT
TO
PROCURE
I
AM
HAPPY
SAID
M
WALDMAN
TO
HAVE
GAINED
A
DISCIPLE
AND
IF
YOUR
APPLICATION
EQUALS
YOUR
ABILITY
I
HAVE
NO
DOUBT
OF
YOUR
SUCCESS
CHEMISTRY
IS
THAT
BRANCH
OF
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
IN
WHICH
THE
GREATEST
IMPROVEMENTS
HAVE
BEEN
AND
MAY
BE
MADE
IT
IS
ON
THAT
ACCOUNT
THAT
I
HAVE
MADE
IT
MY
PECULIAR
STUDY
BUT
AT
THE
SAME
TIME
I
HAVE
NOT
NEGLECTED
THE
OTHER
BRANCHES
OF
SCIENCE
A
MAN
WOULD
MAKE
BUT
A
VERY
SORRY
CHEMIST
IF
HE
ATTENDED
TO
THAT
DEPARTMENT
OF
HUMAN
KNOWLEDGE
ALONE
IF
YOUR
WISH
IS
TO
BECOME
REALLY
A
MAN
OF
SCIENCE
AND
NOT
MERELY
A
PETTY
EXPERIMENTALIST
I
SHOULD
ADVISE
YOU
TO
APPLY
TO
EVERY
BRANCH
OF
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
INCLUDING
MATHEMATICS
HE
THEN
TOOK
ME
INTO
HIS
LABORATORY
AND
EXPLAINED
TO
ME
THE
USES
OF
HIS
VARIOUS
MACHINES
INSTRUCTING
ME
AS
TO
WHAT
I
OUGHT
TO
PROCURE
AND
PROMISING
ME
THE
USE
OF
HIS
OWN
WHEN
I
SHOULD
HAVE
ADVANCED
FAR
ENOUGH
IN
THE
SCIENCE
NOT
TO
DERANGE
THEIR
MECHANISM
HE
ALSO
GAVE
ME
THE
LIST
OF
BOOKS
WHICH
I
HAD
REQUESTED
AND
I
TOOK
MY
LEAVE
THUS
ENDED
A
DAY
MEMORABLE
TO
ME
IT
DECIDED
MY
FUTURE

CHAPTER
4
FROM
THIS
DAY
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
AND
PARTICULARLY
CHEMISTRY
IN
THE
MOST
COMPREHENSIVE
SENSE
OF
THE
TERM
BECAME
NEARLY
MY
SOLE
OCCUPATION
I
READ
WITH
ARDOUR
THOSE
WORKS
SO
FULL
OF
GENIUS
AND
DISCRIMINATION
WHICH
MODERN
INQUIRERS
HAVE
WRITTEN
ON
THESE
SUBJECTS
I
ATTENDED
THE
LECTURES
AND
CULTIVATED
THE
ACQUAINTANCE
OF
THE
MEN
OF
SCIENCE
OF
THE
UNIVERSITY
AND
I
FOUND
EVEN
IN
M
KREMPE
A
GREAT
DEAL
OF
SOUND
SENSE
AND
REAL
INFORMATION
COMBINED
IT
IS
TRUE
WITH
A
REPULSIVE
PHYSIOGNOMY
AND
MANNERS
BUT
NOT
ON
THAT
ACCOUNT
THE
LESS
VALUABLE
IN
M
WALDMAN
I
FOUND
A
TRUE
FRIEND
HIS
GENTLENESS
WAS
NEVER
TINGED
BY
DOGMATISM
AND
HIS
INSTRUCTIONS
WERE
GIVEN
WITH
AN
AIR
OF
FRANKNESS
AND
GOOD
NATURE
THAT
BANISHED
EVERY
IDEA
OF
PEDANTRY
IN
A
THOUSAND
WAYS
HE
SMOOTHED
FOR
ME
THE
PATH
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
MADE
THE
MOST
ABSTRUSE
INQUIRIES
CLEAR
AND
FACILE
TO
MY
APPREHENSION
MY
APPLICATION
WAS
AT
FIRST
FLUCTUATING
AND
UNCERTAIN
IT
GAINED
STRENGTH
AS
I
PROCEEDED
AND
SOON
BECAME
SO
ARDENT
AND
EAGER
THAT
THE
STARS
OFTEN
DISAPPEARED
IN
THE
LIGHT
OF
MORNING
WHILST
I
WAS
YET
ENGAGED
IN
MY
LABORATORY
AS
I
APPLIED
SO
CLOSELY
IT
MAY
BE
EASILY
CONCEIVED
THAT
MY
PROGRESS
WAS
RAPID
MY
ARDOUR
WAS
INDEED
THE
ASTONISHMENT
OF
THE
STUDENTS
AND
MY
PROFICIENCY
THAT
OF
THE
MASTERS
PROFESSOR
KREMPE
OFTEN
ASKED
ME
WITH
A
SLY
SMILE
HOW
CORNELIUS
AGRIPPA
WENT
ON
WHILST
M
WALDMAN
EXPRESSED
THE
MOST
HEARTFELT
EXULTATION
IN
MY
PROGRESS
TWO
YEARS
PASSED
IN
THIS
MANNER
DURING
WHICH
I
PAID
NO
VISIT
TO
GENEVA
BUT
WAS
ENGAGED
HEART
AND
SOUL
IN
THE
PURSUIT
OF
SOME
DISCOVERIES
WHICH
I
HOPED
TO
MAKE
NONE
BUT
THOSE
WHO
HAVE
EXPERIENCED
THEM
CAN
CONCEIVE
OF
THE
ENTICEMENTS
OF
SCIENCE
IN
OTHER
STUDIES
YOU
GO
AS
FAR
AS
OTHERS
HAVE
GONE
BEFORE
YOU
AND
THERE
IS
NOTHING
MORE
TO
KNOW
BUT
IN
A
SCIENTIFIC
PURSUIT
THERE
IS
CONTINUAL
FOOD
FOR
DISCOVERY
AND
WONDER
A
MIND
OF
MODERATE
CAPACITY
WHICH
CLOSELY
PURSUES
ONE
STUDY
MUST
INFALLIBLY
ARRIVE
AT
GREAT
PROFICIENCY
IN
THAT
STUDY
AND
I
WHO
CONTINUALLY
SOUGHT
THE
ATTAINMENT
OF
ONE
OBJECT
OF
PURSUIT
AND
WAS
SOLELY
WRAPPED
UP
IN
THIS
IMPROVED
SO
RAPIDLY
THAT
AT
THE
END
OF
TWO
YEARS
I
MADE
SOME
DISCOVERIES
IN
THE
IMPROVEMENT
OF
SOME
CHEMICAL
INSTRUMENTS
WHICH
PROCURED
ME
GREAT
ESTEEM
AND
ADMIRATION
AT
THE
UNIVERSITY
WHEN
I
HAD
ARRIVED
AT
THIS
POINT
AND
HAD
BECOME
AS
WELL
ACQUAINTED
WITH
THE
THEORY
AND
PRACTICE
OF
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
AS
DEPENDED
ON
THE
LESSONS
OF
ANY
OF
THE
PROFESSORS
AT
INGOLSTADT
MY
RESIDENCE
THERE
BEING
NO
LONGER
CONDUCIVE
TO
MY
IMPROVEMENTS
I
THOUGHT
OF
RETURNING
TO
MY
FRIENDS
AND
MY
NATIVE
TOWN
WHEN
AN
INCIDENT
HAPPENED
THAT
PROTRACTED
MY
STAY
ONE
OF
THE
PHENOMENA
WHICH
HAD
PECULIARLY
ATTRACTED
MY
ATTENTION
WAS
THE
STRUCTURE
OF
THE
HUMAN
FRAME
AND
INDEED
ANY
ANIMAL
ENDUED
WITH
LIFE
WHENCE
I
OFTEN
ASKED
MYSELF
DID
THE
PRINCIPLE
OF
LIFE
PROCEED
IT
WAS
A
BOLD
QUESTION
AND
ONE
WHICH
HAS
EVER
BEEN
CONSIDERED
AS
A
MYSTERY
YET
WITH
HOW
MANY
THINGS
ARE
WE
UPON
THE
BRINK
OF
BECOMING
ACQUAINTED
IF
COWARDICE
OR
CARELESSNESS
DID
NOT
RESTRAIN
OUR
INQUIRIES
I
REVOLVED
THESE
CIRCUMSTANCES
IN
MY
MIND
AND
DETERMINED
THENCEFORTH
TO
APPLY
MYSELF
MORE
PARTICULARLY
TO
THOSE
BRANCHES
OF
NATURAL
PHILOSOPHY
WHICH
RELATE
TO
PHYSIOLOGY
UNLESS
I
HAD
BEEN
ANIMATED
BY
AN
ALMOST
SUPERNATURAL
ENTHUSIASM
MY
APPLICATION
TO
THIS
STUDY
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
IRKSOME
AND
ALMOST
INTOLERABLE
TO
EXAMINE
THE
CAUSES
OF
LIFE
WE
MUST
FIRST
HAVE
RECOURSE
TO
DEATH
I
BECAME
ACQUAINTED
WITH
THE
SCIENCE
OF
ANATOMY
BUT
THIS
WAS
NOT
SUFFICIENT
I
MUST
ALSO
OBSERVE
THE
NATURAL
DECAY
AND
CORRUPTION
OF
THE
HUMAN
BODY
IN
MY
EDUCATION
MY
FATHER
HAD
TAKEN
THE
GREATEST
PRECAUTIONS
THAT
MY
MIND
SHOULD
BE
IMPRESSED
WITH
NO
SUPERNATURAL
HORRORS
I
DO
NOT
EVER
REMEMBER
TO
HAVE
TREMBLED
AT
A
TALE
OF
SUPERSTITION
OR
TO
HAVE
FEARED
THE
APPARITION
OF
A
SPIRIT
DARKNESS
HAD
NO
EFFECT
UPON
MY
FANCY
AND
A
CHURCHYARD
WAS
TO
ME
MERELY
THE
RECEPTACLE
OF
BODIES
DEPRIVED
OF
LIFE
WHICH
FROM
BEING
THE
SEAT
OF
BEAUTY
AND
STRENGTH
HAD
BECOME
FOOD
FOR
THE
WORM
NOW
I
WAS
LED
TO
EXAMINE
THE
CAUSE
AND
PROGRESS
OF
THIS
DECAY
AND
FORCED
TO
SPEND
DAYS
AND
NIGHTS
IN
VAULTS
AND
CHARNELHOUSES
MY
ATTENTION
WAS
FIXED
UPON
EVERY
OBJECT
THE
MOST
INSUPPORTABLE
TO
THE
DELICACY
OF
THE
HUMAN
FEELINGS
I
SAW
HOW
THE
FINE
FORM
OF
MAN
WAS
DEGRADED
AND
WASTED
I
BEHELD
THE
CORRUPTION
OF
DEATH
SUCCEED
TO
THE
BLOOMING
CHEEK
OF
LIFE
I
SAW
HOW
THE
WORM
INHERITED
THE
WONDERS
OF
THE
EYE
AND
BRAIN
I
PAUSED
EXAMINING
AND
ANALYSING
ALL
THE
MINUTIAE
OF
CAUSATION
AS
EXEMPLIFIED
IN
THE
CHANGE
FROM
LIFE
TO
DEATH
AND
DEATH
TO
LIFE
UNTIL
FROM
THE
MIDST
OF
THIS
DARKNESS
A
SUDDEN
LIGHT
BROKE
IN
UPON
MEA
LIGHT
SO
BRILLIANT
AND
WONDROUS
YET
SO
SIMPLE
THAT
WHILE
I
BECAME
DIZZY
WITH
THE
IMMENSITY
OF
THE
PROSPECT
WHICH
IT
ILLUSTRATED
I
WAS
SURPRISED
THAT
AMONG
SO
MANY
MEN
OF
GENIUS
WHO
HAD
DIRECTED
THEIR
INQUIRIES
TOWARDS
THE
SAME
SCIENCE
THAT
I
ALONE
SHOULD
BE
RESERVED
TO
DISCOVER
SO
ASTONISHING
A
SECRET
REMEMBER
I
AM
NOT
RECORDING
THE
VISION
OF
A
MADMAN
THE
SUN
DOES
NOT
MORE
CERTAINLY
SHINE
IN
THE
HEAVENS
THAN
THAT
WHICH
I
NOW
AFFIRM
IS
TRUE
SOME
MIRACLE
MIGHT
HAVE
PRODUCED
IT
YET
THE
STAGES
OF
THE
DISCOVERY
WERE
DISTINCT
AND
PROBABLE
AFTER
DAYS
AND
NIGHTS
OF
INCREDIBLE
LABOUR
AND
FATIGUE
I
SUCCEEDED
IN
DISCOVERING
THE
CAUSE
OF
GENERATION
AND
LIFE
NAY
MORE
I
BECAME
MYSELF
CAPABLE
OF
BESTOWING
ANIMATION
UPON
LIFELESS
MATTER
THE
ASTONISHMENT
WHICH
I
HAD
AT
FIRST
EXPERIENCED
ON
THIS
DISCOVERY
SOON
GAVE
PLACE
TO
DELIGHT
AND
RAPTURE
AFTER
SO
MUCH
TIME
SPENT
IN
PAINFUL
LABOUR
TO
ARRIVE
AT
ONCE
AT
THE
SUMMIT
OF
MY
DESIRES
WAS
THE
MOST
GRATIFYING
CONSUMMATION
OF
MY
TOILS
BUT
THIS
DISCOVERY
WAS
SO
GREAT
AND
OVERWHELMING
THAT
ALL
THE
STEPS
BY
WHICH
I
HAD
BEEN
PROGRESSIVELY
LED
TO
IT
WERE
OBLITERATED
AND
I
BEHELD
ONLY
THE
RESULT
WHAT
HAD
BEEN
THE
STUDY
AND
DESIRE
OF
THE
WISEST
MEN
SINCE
THE
CREATION
OF
THE
WORLD
WAS
NOW
WITHIN
MY
GRASP
NOT
THAT
LIKE
A
MAGIC
SCENE
IT
ALL
OPENED
UPON
ME
AT
ONCE:
THE
INFORMATION
I
HAD
OBTAINED
WAS
OF
A
NATURE
RATHER
TO
DIRECT
MY
ENDEAVOURS
SO
SOON
AS
I
SHOULD
POINT
THEM
TOWARDS
THE
OBJECT
OF
MY
SEARCH
THAN
TO
EXHIBIT
THAT
OBJECT
ALREADY
ACCOMPLISHED
I
WAS
LIKE
THE
ARABIAN
WHO
HAD
BEEN
BURIED
WITH
THE
DEAD
AND
FOUND
A
PASSAGE
TO
LIFE
AIDED
ONLY
BY
ONE
GLIMMERING
AND
SEEMINGLY
INEFFECTUAL
LIGHT
I
SEE
BY
YOUR
EAGERNESS
AND
THE
WONDER
AND
HOPE
WHICH
YOUR
EYES
EXPRESS
MY
FRIEND
THAT
YOU
EXPECT
TO
BE
INFORMED
OF
THE
SECRET
WITH
WHICH
I
AM
ACQUAINTED
THAT
CANNOT
BE
LISTEN
PATIENTLY
UNTIL
THE
END
OF
MY
STORY
AND
YOU
WILL
EASILY
PERCEIVE
WHY
I
AM
RESERVED
UPON
THAT
SUBJECT
I
WILL
NOT
LEAD
YOU
ON
UNGUARDED
AND
ARDENT
AS
I
THEN
WAS
TO
YOUR
DESTRUCTION
AND
INFALLIBLE
MISERY
LEARN
FROM
ME
IF
NOT
BY
MY
PRECEPTS
AT
LEAST
BY
MY
EXAMPLE
HOW
DANGEROUS
IS
THE
ACQUIREMENT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
AND
HOW
MUCH
HAPPIER
THAT
MAN
IS
WHO
BELIEVES
HIS
NATIVE
TOWN
TO
BE
THE
WORLD
THAN
HE
WHO
ASPIRES
TO
BECOME
GREATER
THAN
HIS
NATURE
WILL
ALLOW
WHEN
I
FOUND
SO
ASTONISHING
A
POWER
PLACED
WITHIN
MY
HANDS
I
HESITATED
A
LONG
TIME
CONCERNING
THE
MANNER
IN
WHICH
I
SHOULD
EMPLOY
IT
ALTHOUGH
I
POSSESSED
THE
CAPACITY
OF
BESTOWING
ANIMATION
YET
TO
PREPARE
A
FRAME
FOR
THE
RECEPTION
OF
IT
WITH
ALL
ITS
INTRICACIES
OF
FIBRES
MUSCLES
AND
VEINS
STILL
REMAINED
A
WORK
OF
INCONCEIVABLE
DIFFICULTY
AND
LABOUR
I
DOUBTED
AT
FIRST
WHETHER
I
SHOULD
ATTEMPT
THE
CREATION
OF
A
BEING
LIKE
MYSELF
OR
ONE
OF
SIMPLER
ORGANIZATION
BUT
MY
IMAGINATION
WAS
TOO
MUCH
EXALTED
BY
MY
FIRST
SUCCESS
TO
PERMIT
ME
TO
DOUBT
OF
MY
ABILITY
TO
GIVE
LIFE
TO
AN
ANIMAL
AS
COMPLETE
AND
WONDERFUL
AS
MAN
THE
MATERIALS
AT
PRESENT
WITHIN
MY
COMMAND
HARDLY
APPEARED
ADEQUATE
TO
SO
ARDUOUS
AN
UNDERTAKING
BUT
I
DOUBTED
NOT
THAT
I
SHOULD
ULTIMATELY
SUCCEED
I
PREPARED
MYSELF
FOR
A
MULTITUDE
OF
REVERSES
MY
OPERATIONS
MIGHT
BE
INCESSANTLY
BAFFLED
AND
AT
LAST
MY
WORK
BE
IMPERFECT
YET
WHEN
I
CONSIDERED
THE
IMPROVEMENT
WHICH
EVERY
DAY
TAKES
PLACE
IN
SCIENCE
AND
MECHANICS
I
WAS
ENCOURAGED
TO
HOPE
MY
PRESENT
ATTEMPTS
WOULD
AT
LEAST
LAY
THE
FOUNDATIONS
OF
FUTURE
SUCCESS
NOR
COULD
I
CONSIDER
THE
MAGNITUDE
AND
COMPLEXITY
OF
MY
PLAN
AS
ANY
ARGUMENT
OF
ITS
IMPRACTICABILITY
IT
WAS
WITH
THESE
FEELINGS
THAT
I
BEGAN
THE
CREATION
OF
A
HUMAN
BEING
AS
THE
MINUTENESS
OF
THE
PARTS
FORMED
A
GREAT
HINDRANCE
TO
MY
SPEED
I
RESOLVED
CONTRARY
TO
MY
FIRST
INTENTION
TO
MAKE
THE
BEING
OF
A
GIGANTIC
STATURE
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
ABOUT
EIGHT
FEET
IN
HEIGHT
AND
PROPORTIONABLY
LARGE
AFTER
HAVING
FORMED
THIS
DETERMINATION
AND
HAVING
SPENT
SOME
MONTHS
IN
SUCCESSFULLY
COLLECTING
AND
ARRANGING
MY
MATERIALS
I
BEGAN
NO
ONE
CAN
CONCEIVE
THE
VARIETY
OF
FEELINGS
WHICH
BORE
ME
ONWARDS
LIKE
A
HURRICANE
IN
THE
FIRST
ENTHUSIASM
OF
SUCCESS
LIFE
AND
DEATH
APPEARED
TO
ME
IDEAL
BOUNDS
WHICH
I
SHOULD
FIRST
BREAK
THROUGH
AND
POUR
A
TORRENT
OF
LIGHT
INTO
OUR
DARK
WORLD
A
NEW
SPECIES
WOULD
BLESS
ME
AS
ITS
CREATOR
AND
SOURCE
MANY
HAPPY
AND
EXCELLENT
NATURES
WOULD
OWE
THEIR
BEING
TO
ME
NO
FATHER
COULD
CLAIM
THE
GRATITUDE
OF
HIS
CHILD
SO
COMPLETELY
AS
I
SHOULD
DESERVE
THEIRS
PURSUING
THESE
REFLECTIONS
I
THOUGHT
THAT
IF
I
COULD
BESTOW
ANIMATION
UPON
LIFELESS
MATTER
I
MIGHT
IN
PROCESS
OF
TIME
(ALTHOUGH
I
NOW
FOUND
IT
IMPOSSIBLE)
RENEW
LIFE
WHERE
DEATH
HAD
APPARENTLY
DEVOTED
THE
BODY
TO
CORRUPTION
THESE
THOUGHTS
SUPPORTED
MY
SPIRITS
WHILE
I
PURSUED
MY
UNDERTAKING
WITH
UNREMITTING
ARDOUR
MY
CHEEK
HAD
GROWN
PALE
WITH
STUDY
AND
MY
PERSON
HAD
BECOME
EMACIATED
WITH
CONFINEMENT
SOMETIMES
ON
THE
VERY
BRINK
OF
CERTAINTY
I
FAILED
YET
STILL
I
CLUNG
TO
THE
HOPE
WHICH
THE
NEXT
DAY
OR
THE
NEXT
HOUR
MIGHT
REALIZE
ONE
SECRET
WHICH
I
ALONE
POSSESSED
WAS
THE
HOPE
TO
WHICH
I
HAD
DEDICATED
MYSELF
AND
THE
MOON
GAZED
ON
MY
MIDNIGHT
LABOURS
WHILE
WITH
UNRELAXED
AND
BREATHLESS
EAGERNESS
I
PURSUED
NATURE
TO
HER
HIDINGPLACES
WHO
SHALL
CONCEIVE
THE
HORRORS
OF
MY
SECRET
TOIL
AS
I
DABBLED
AMONG
THE
UNHALLOWED
DAMPS
OF
THE
GRAVE
OR
TORTURED
THE
LIVING
ANIMAL
TO
ANIMATE
THE
LIFELESS
CLAY
MY
LIMBS
NOW
TREMBLE
AND
MY
EYES
SWIM
WITH
THE
REMEMBRANCE
BUT
THEN
A
RESISTLESS
AND
ALMOST
FRANTIC
IMPULSE
URGED
ME
FORWARD
I
SEEMED
TO
HAVE
LOST
ALL
SOUL
OR
SENSATION
BUT
FOR
THIS
ONE
PURSUIT
IT
WAS
INDEED
BUT
A
PASSING
TRANCE
THAT
ONLY
MADE
ME
FEEL
WITH
RENEWED
ACUTENESS
SO
SOON
AS
THE
UNNATURAL
STIMULUS
CEASING
TO
OPERATE
I
HAD
RETURNED
TO
MY
OLD
HABITS
I
COLLECTED
BONES
FROM
CHARNELHOUSES
AND
DISTURBED
WITH
PROFANE
FINGERS
THE
TREMENDOUS
SECRETS
OF
THE
HUMAN
FRAME
IN
A
SOLITARY
CHAMBER
OR
RATHER
CELL
AT
THE
TOP
OF
THE
HOUSE
AND
SEPARATED
FROM
ALL
THE
OTHER
APARTMENTS
BY
A
GALLERY
AND
STAIRCASE
I
KEPT
MY
WORKSHOP
OF
FILTHY
CREATION
MY
EYEBALLS
WERE
STARTING
FROM
THEIR
SOCKETS
IN
ATTENDING
TO
THE
DETAILS
OF
MY
EMPLOYMENT
THE
DISSECTING
ROOM
AND
THE
SLAUGHTERHOUSE
FURNISHED
MANY
OF
MY
MATERIALS
AND
OFTEN
DID
MY
HUMAN
NATURE
TURN
WITH
LOATHING
FROM
MY
OCCUPATION
WHILST
STILL
URGED
ON
BY
AN
EAGERNESS
WHICH
PERPETUALLY
INCREASED
I
BROUGHT
MY
WORK
NEAR
TO
A
CONCLUSION
THE
SUMMER
MONTHS
PASSED
WHILE
I
WAS
THUS
ENGAGED
HEART
AND
SOUL
IN
ONE
PURSUIT
IT
WAS
A
MOST
BEAUTIFUL
SEASON
NEVER
DID
THE
FIELDS
BESTOW
A
MORE
PLENTIFUL
HARVEST
OR
THE
VINES
YIELD
A
MORE
LUXURIANT
VINTAGE
BUT
MY
EYES
WERE
INSENSIBLE
TO
THE
CHARMS
OF
NATURE
AND
THE
SAME
FEELINGS
WHICH
MADE
ME
NEGLECT
THE
SCENES
AROUND
ME
CAUSED
ME
ALSO
TO
FORGET
THOSE
FRIENDS
WHO
WERE
SO
MANY
MILES
ABSENT
AND
WHOM
I
HAD
NOT
SEEN
FOR
SO
LONG
A
TIME
I
KNEW
MY
SILENCE
DISQUIETED
THEM
AND
I
WELL
REMEMBERED
THE
WORDS
OF
MY
FATHER:
I
KNOW
THAT
WHILE
YOU
ARE
PLEASED
WITH
YOURSELF
YOU
WILL
THINK
OF
US
WITH
AFFECTION
AND
WE
SHALL
HEAR
REGULARLY
FROM
YOU
YOU
MUST
PARDON
ME
IF
I
REGARD
ANY
INTERRUPTION
IN
YOUR
CORRESPONDENCE
AS
A
PROOF
THAT
YOUR
OTHER
DUTIES
ARE
EQUALLY
NEGLECTED
I
KNEW
WELL
THEREFORE
WHAT
WOULD
BE
MY
FATHERS
FEELINGS
BUT
I
COULD
NOT
TEAR
MY
THOUGHTS
FROM
MY
EMPLOYMENT
LOATHSOME
IN
ITSELF
BUT
WHICH
HAD
TAKEN
AN
IRRESISTIBLE
HOLD
OF
MY
IMAGINATION
I
WISHED
AS
IT
WERE
TO
PROCRASTINATE
ALL
THAT
RELATED
TO
MY
FEELINGS
OF
AFFECTION
UNTIL
THE
GREAT
OBJECT
WHICH
SWALLOWED
UP
EVERY
HABIT
OF
MY
NATURE
SHOULD
BE
COMPLETED
I
THEN
THOUGHT
THAT
MY
FATHER
WOULD
BE
UNJUST
IF
HE
ASCRIBED
MY
NEGLECT
TO
VICE
OR
FAULTINESS
ON
MY
PART
BUT
I
AM
NOW
CONVINCED
THAT
HE
WAS
JUSTIFIED
IN
CONCEIVING
THAT
I
SHOULD
NOT
BE
ALTOGETHER
FREE
FROM
BLAME
A
HUMAN
BEING
IN
PERFECTION
OUGHT
ALWAYS
TO
PRESERVE
A
CALM
AND
PEACEFUL
MIND
AND
NEVER
TO
ALLOW
PASSION
OR
A
TRANSITORY
DESIRE
TO
DISTURB
HIS
TRANQUILLITY
I
DO
NOT
THINK
THAT
THE
PURSUIT
OF
KNOWLEDGE
IS
AN
EXCEPTION
TO
THIS
RULE
IF
THE
STUDY
TO
WHICH
YOU
APPLY
YOURSELF
HAS
A
TENDENCY
TO
WEAKEN
YOUR
AFFECTIONS
AND
TO
DESTROY
YOUR
TASTE
FOR
THOSE
SIMPLE
PLEASURES
IN
WHICH
NO
ALLOY
CAN
POSSIBLY
MIX
THEN
THAT
STUDY
IS
CERTAINLY
UNLAWFUL
THAT
IS
TO
SAY
NOT
BEFITTING
THE
HUMAN
MIND
IF
THIS
RULE
WERE
ALWAYS
OBSERVED
IF
NO
MAN
ALLOWED
ANY
PURSUIT
WHATSOEVER
TO
INTERFERE
WITH
THE
TRANQUILLITY
OF
HIS
DOMESTIC
AFFECTIONS
GREECE
HAD
NOT
BEEN
ENSLAVED
CAESAR
WOULD
HAVE
SPARED
HIS
COUNTRY
AMERICA
WOULD
HAVE
BEEN
DISCOVERED
MORE
GRADUALLY
AND
THE
EMPIRES
OF
MEXICO
AND
PERU
HAD
NOT
BEEN
DESTROYED
BUT
I
FORGET
THAT
I
AM
MORALIZING
IN
THE
MOST
INTERESTING
PART
OF
MY
TALE
AND
YOUR
LOOKS
REMIND
ME
TO
PROCEED
MY
FATHER
MADE
NO
REPROACH
IN
HIS
LETTERS
AND
ONLY
TOOK
NOTICE
OF
MY
SCIENCE
BY
INQUIRING
INTO
MY
OCCUPATIONS
MORE
PARTICULARLY
THAN
BEFORE
WINTER
SPRING
AND
SUMMER
PASSED
AWAY
DURING
MY
LABOURS
BUT
I
DID
NOT
WATCH
THE
BLOSSOM
OR
THE
EXPANDING
LEAVESSIGHTS
WHICH
BEFORE
ALWAYS
YIELDED
ME
SUPREME
DELIGHTSO
DEEPLY
WAS
I
ENGROSSED
IN
MY
OCCUPATION
THE
LEAVES
OF
THAT
YEAR
HAD
WITHERED
BEFORE
MY
WORK
DREW
NEAR
TO
A
CLOSE
AND
NOW
EVERY
DAY
SHOWED
ME
MORE
PLAINLY
HOW
WELL
I
HAD
SUCCEEDED
BUT
MY
ENTHUSIASM
WAS
CHECKED
BY
MY
ANXIETY
AND
I
APPEARED
RATHER
LIKE
ONE
DOOMED
BY
SLAVERY
TO
TOIL
IN
THE
MINES
OR
ANY
OTHER
UNWHOLESOME
TRADE
THAN
AN
ARTIST
OCCUPIED
BY
HIS
FAVOURITE
EMPLOYMENT
EVERY
NIGHT
I
WAS
OPPRESSED
BY
A
SLOW
FEVER
AND
I
BECAME
NERVOUS
TO
A
MOST
PAINFUL
DEGREE
THE
FALL
OF
A
LEAF
STARTLED
ME
AND
I
SHUNNED
MY
FELLOW
CREATURES
AS
IF
I
HAD
BEEN
GUILTY
OF
A
CRIME
SOMETIMES
I
GREW
ALARMED
AT
THE
WRECK
I
PERCEIVED
THAT
I
HAD
BECOME
THE
ENERGY
OF
MY
PURPOSE
ALONE
SUSTAINED
ME:
MY
LABOURS
WOULD
SOON
END
AND
I
BELIEVED
THAT
EXERCISE
AND
AMUSEMENT
WOULD
THEN
DRIVE
AWAY
INCIPIENT
DISEASE
AND
I
PROMISED
MYSELF
BOTH
OF
THESE
WHEN
MY
CREATION
SHOULD
BE
COMPLETE
CHAPTER
5
IT
WAS
ON
A
DREARY
NIGHT
OF
NOVEMBER
THAT
I
BEHELD
THE
ACCOMPLISHMENT
OF
MY
TOILS
WITH
AN
ANXIETY
THAT
ALMOST
AMOUNTED
TO
AGONY
I
COLLECTED
THE
INSTRUMENTS
OF
LIFE
AROUND
ME
THAT
I
MIGHT
INFUSE
A
SPARK
OF
BEING
INTO
THE
LIFELESS
THING
THAT
LAY
AT
MY
FEET
IT
WAS
ALREADY
ONE
IN
THE
MORNING
THE
RAIN
PATTERED
DISMALLY
AGAINST
THE
PANES
AND
MY
CANDLE
WAS
NEARLY
BURNT
OUT
WHEN
BY
THE
GLIMMER
OF
THE
HALFEXTINGUISHED
LIGHT
I
SAW
THE
DULL
YELLOW
EYE
OF
THE
CREATURE
OPEN
IT
BREATHED
HARD
AND
A
CONVULSIVE
MOTION
AGITATED
ITS
LIMBS
HOW
CAN
I
DESCRIBE
MY
EMOTIONS
AT
THIS
CATASTROPHE
OR
HOW
DELINEATE
THE
WRETCH
WHOM
WITH
SUCH
INFINITE
PAINS
AND
CARE
I
HAD
ENDEAVOURED
TO
FORM
HIS
LIMBS
WERE
IN
PROPORTION
AND
I
HAD
SELECTED
HIS
FEATURES
AS
BEAUTIFUL
BEAUTIFUL!
GREAT
GOD!
HIS
YELLOW
SKIN
SCARCELY
COVERED
THE
WORK
OF
MUSCLES
AND
ARTERIES
BENEATH
HIS
HAIR
WAS
OF
A
LUSTROUS
BLACK
AND
FLOWING
HIS
TEETH
OF
A
PEARLY
WHITENESS
BUT
THESE
LUXURIANCES
ONLY
FORMED
A
MORE
HORRID
CONTRAST
WITH
HIS
WATERY
EYES
THAT
SEEMED
ALMOST
OF
THE
SAME
COLOUR
AS
THE
DUNWHITE
SOCKETS
IN
WHICH
THEY
WERE
SET
HIS
SHRIVELLED
COMPLEXION
AND
STRAIGHT
BLACK
LIPS
THE
DIFFERENT
ACCIDENTS
OF
LIFE
ARE
NOT
SO
CHANGEABLE
AS
THE
FEELINGS
OF
HUMAN
NATURE
I
HAD
WORKED
HARD
FOR
NEARLY
TWO
YEARS
FOR
THE
SOLE
PURPOSE
OF
INFUSING
LIFE
INTO
AN
INANIMATE
BODY
FOR
THIS
I
HAD
DEPRIVED
MYSELF
OF
REST
AND
HEALTH
I
HAD
DESIRED
IT
WITH
AN
ARDOUR
THAT
FAR
EXCEEDED
MODERATION
BUT
NOW
THAT
I
HAD
FINISHED
THE
BEAUTY
OF
THE
DREAM
VANISHED
AND
BREATHLESS
HORROR
AND
DISGUST
FILLED
MY
HEART
UNABLE
TO
ENDURE
THE
ASPECT
OF
THE
BEING
I
HAD
CREATED
I
RUSHED
OUT
OF
THE
ROOM
AND
CONTINUED
A
LONG
TIME
TRAVERSING
MY
BEDCHAMBER
UNABLE
TO
COMPOSE
MY
MIND
TO
SLEEP
AT
LENGTH
LASSITUDE
SUCCEEDED
TO
THE
TUMULT
I
HAD
BEFORE
ENDURED
AND
I
THREW
MYSELF
ON
THE
BED
IN
MY
CLOTHES
ENDEAVOURING
TO
SEEK
A
FEW
MOMENTS
OF
FORGETFULNESS
BUT
IT
WAS
IN
VAIN
I
SLEPT
INDEED
BUT
I
WAS
DISTURBED
BY
THE
WILDEST
DREAMS
I
THOUGHT
I
SAW
ELIZABETH
IN
THE
BLOOM
OF
HEALTH
WALKING
IN
THE
STREETS
OF
INGOLSTADT
DELIGHTED
AND
SURPRISED
I
EMBRACED
HER
BUT
AS
I
IMPRINTED
THE
FIRST
KISS
ON
HER
LIPS
THEY
BECAME
LIVID
WITH
THE
HUE
OF
DEATH
HER
FEATURES
APPEARED
TO
CHANGE
AND
I
THOUGHT
THAT
I
HELD
THE
CORPSE
OF
MY
DEAD
MOTHER
IN
MY
ARMS
A
SHROUD
ENVELOPED
HER
FORM
AND
I
SAW
THE
GRAVEWORMS
CRAWLING
IN
THE
FOLDS
OF
THE
FLANNEL
I
STARTED
FROM
MY
SLEEP
WITH
HORROR
A
COLD
DEW
COVERED
MY
FOREHEAD
MY
TEETH
CHATTERED
AND
EVERY
LIMB
BECAME
CONVULSED
WHEN
BY
THE
DIM
AND
YELLOW
LIGHT
OF
THE
MOON
AS
IT
FORCED
ITS
WAY
THROUGH
THE
WINDOW
SHUTTERS
I
BEHELD
THE
WRETCHTHE
MISERABLE
MONSTER
WHOM
I
HAD
CREATED
HE
HELD
UP
THE
CURTAIN
OF
THE
BED
AND
HIS
EYES
IF
EYES
THEY
MAY
BE
CALLED
WERE
FIXED
ON
ME
HIS
JAWS
OPENED
AND
HE
MUTTERED
SOME
INARTICULATE
SOUNDS
WHILE
A
GRIN
WRINKLED
HIS
CHEEKS
HE
MIGHT
HAVE
SPOKEN
BUT
I
DID
NOT
HEAR
ONE
HAND
WAS
STRETCHED
OUT
SEEMINGLY
TO
DETAIN
ME
BUT
I
ESCAPED
AND
RUSHED
DOWNSTAIRS
I
TOOK
REFUGE
IN
THE
COURTYARD
BELONGING
TO
THE
HOUSE
WHICH
I
INHABITED
WHERE
I
REMAINED
DURING
THE
REST
OF
THE
NIGHT
WALKING
UP
AND
DOWN
IN
THE
GREATEST
AGITATION
LISTENING
ATTENTIVELY
CATCHING
AND
FEARING
EACH
SOUND
AS
IF
IT
WERE
TO
ANNOUNCE
THE
APPROACH
OF
THE
DEMONIACAL
CORPSE
TO
WHICH
I
HAD
SO
MISERABLY
GIVEN
LIFE
OH!
NO
MORTAL
COULD
SUPPORT
THE
HORROR
OF
THAT
COUNTENANCE
A
MUMMY
AGAIN
ENDUED
WITH
ANIMATION
COULD
NOT
BE
SO
HIDEOUS
AS
THAT
WRETCH
I
HAD
GAZED
ON
HIM
WHILE
UNFINISHED
HE
WAS
UGLY
THEN
BUT
WHEN
THOSE
MUSCLES
AND
JOINTS
WERE
RENDERED
CAPABLE
OF
MOTION
IT
BECAME
A
THING
SUCH
AS
EVEN
DANTE
COULD
NOT
HAVE
CONCEIVED
I
PASSED
THE
NIGHT
WRETCHEDLY
SOMETIMES
MY
PULSE
BEAT
SO
QUICKLY
AND
HARDLY
THAT
I
FELT
THE
PALPITATION
OF
EVERY
ARTERY
AT
OTHERS
I
NEARLY
SANK
TO
THE
GROUND
THROUGH
LANGUOR
AND
EXTREME
WEAKNESS
MINGLED
WITH
THIS
HORROR
I
FELT
THE
BITTERNESS
OF
DISAPPOINTMENT
DREAMS
THAT
HAD
BEEN
MY
FOOD
AND
PLEASANT
REST
FOR
SO
LONG
A
SPACE
WERE
NOW
BECOME
A
HELL
TO
ME
AND
THE
CHANGE
WAS
SO
RAPID
THE
OVERTHROW
SO
COMPLETE!
MORNING
DISMAL
AND
WET
AT
LENGTH
DAWNED
AND
DISCOVERED
TO
MY
SLEEPLESS
AND
ACHING
EYES
THE
CHURCH
OF
INGOLSTADT
ITS
WHITE
STEEPLE
AND
CLOCK
WHICH
INDICATED
THE
SIXTH
HOUR
THE
PORTER
OPENED
THE
GATES
OF
THE
COURT
WHICH
HAD
THAT
NIGHT
BEEN
MY
ASYLUM
AND
I
ISSUED
INTO
THE
STREETS
PACING
THEM
WITH
QUICK
STEPS
AS
IF
I
SOUGHT
TO
AVOID
THE
WRETCH
WHOM
I
FEARED
EVERY
TURNING
OF
THE
STREET
WOULD
PRESENT
TO
MY
VIEW
I
DID
NOT
DARE
RETURN
TO
THE
APARTMENT
WHICH
I
INHABITED
BUT
FELT
IMPELLED
TO
HURRY
ON
ALTHOUGH
DRENCHED
BY
THE
RAIN
WHICH
POURED
FROM
A
BLACK
AND
COMFORTLESS
SKY
I
CONTINUED
WALKING
IN
THIS
MANNER
FOR
SOME
TIME
ENDEAVOURING
BY
BODILY
EXERCISE
TO
EASE
THE
LOAD
THAT
WEIGHED
UPON
MY
MIND
I
TRAVERSED
THE
STREETS
WITHOUT
ANY
CLEAR
CONCEPTION
OF
WHERE
I
WAS
OR
WHAT
I
WAS
DOING
MY
HEART
PALPITATED
IN
THE
SICKNESS
OF
FEAR
AND
I
HURRIED
ON
WITH
IRREGULAR
STEPS
NOT
DARING
TO
LOOK
ABOUT
ME:
LIKE
ONE
WHO
ON
A
LONELY
ROAD
DOTH
WALK
IN
FEAR
AND
DREAD
AND
HAVING
ONCE
TURNED
ROUND
WALKS
ON
AND
TURNS
NO
MORE
HIS
HEAD
BECAUSE
HE
KNOWS
A
FRIGHTFUL
FIEND
DOTH
CLOSE
BEHIND
HIM
TREAD
[COLERIDGES
ANCIENT
MARINER]
CONTINUING
THUS
I
CAME
AT
LENGTH
OPPOSITE
TO
THE
INN
AT
WHICH
THE
VARIOUS
DILIGENCES
AND
CARRIAGES
USUALLY
STOPPED
HERE
I
PAUSED
I
KNEW
NOT
WHY
BUT
I
REMAINED
SOME
MINUTES
WITH
MY
EYES
FIXED
ON
A
COACH
THAT
WAS
COMING
TOWARDS
ME
FROM
THE
OTHER
END
OF
THE
STREET
AS
IT
DREW
NEARER
I
OBSERVED
THAT
IT
WAS
THE
SWISS
DILIGENCE
IT
STOPPED
JUST
WHERE
I
WAS
STANDING
AND
ON
THE
DOOR
BEING
OPENED
I
PERCEIVED
HENRY
CLERVAL
WHO
ON
SEEING
ME
INSTANTLY
SPRUNG
OUT
MY
DEAR
FRANKENSTEIN
EXCLAIMED
HE
HOW
GLAD
I
AM
TO
SEE
YOU!
HOW
FORTUNATE
THAT
YOU
SHOULD
BE
HERE
AT
THE
VERY
MOMENT
OF
MY
ALIGHTING!
NOTHING
COULD
EQUAL
MY
DELIGHT
ON
SEEING
CLERVAL
HIS
PRESENCE
BROUGHT
BACK
TO
MY
THOUGHTS
MY
FATHER
ELIZABETH
AND
ALL
THOSE
SCENES
OF
HOME
SO
DEAR
TO
MY
RECOLLECTION
I
GRASPED
HIS
HAND
AND
IN
A
MOMENT
FORGOT
MY
HORROR
AND
MISFORTUNE
I
FELT
SUDDENLY
AND
FOR
THE
FIRST
TIME
DURING
MANY
MONTHS
CALM
AND
SERENE
JOY
I
WELCOMED
MY
FRIEND
THEREFORE
IN
THE
MOST
CORDIAL
MANNER
AND
WE
WALKED
TOWARDS
MY
COLLEGE
CLERVAL
CONTINUED
TALKING
FOR
SOME
TIME
ABOUT
OUR
MUTUAL
FRIENDS
AND
HIS
OWN
GOOD
FORTUNE
IN
BEING
PERMITTED
TO
COME
TO
INGOLSTADT
YOU
MAY
EASILY
BELIEVE
SAID
HE
HOW
GREAT
WAS
THE
DIFFICULTY
TO
PERSUADE
MY
FATHER
THAT
ALL
NECESSARY
KNOWLEDGE
WAS
NOT
COMPRISED
IN
THE
NOBLE
ART
OF
BOOKKEEPING
AND
INDEED
I
BELIEVE
I
LEFT
HIM
INCREDULOUS
TO
THE
LAST
FOR
HIS
CONSTANT
ANSWER
TO
MY
UNWEARIED
ENTREATIES
WAS
THE
SAME
AS
THAT
OF
THE
DUTCH
SCHOOLMASTER
IN
*THE
VICAR
OF
WAKEFIELD*:
`I
HAVE
TEN
THOUSAND
FLORINS
A
YEAR
WITHOUT
GREEK
I
EAT
HEARTILY
WITHOUT
GREEK
BUT
HIS
AFFECTION
FOR
ME
AT
LENGTH
OVERCAME
HIS
DISLIKE
OF
LEARNING
AND
HE
HAS
PERMITTED
ME
TO
UNDERTAKE
A
VOYAGE
OF
DISCOVERY
TO
THE
LAND
OF
KNOWLEDGE
IT
GIVES
ME
THE
GREATEST
DELIGHT
TO
SEE
YOU
BUT
TELL
ME
HOW
YOU
LEFT
MY
FATHER
BROTHERS
AND
ELIZABETH
VERY
WELL
AND
VERY
HAPPY
ONLY
A
LITTLE
UNEASY
THAT
THEY
HEAR
FROM
YOU
SO
SELDOM
BY
THE
BY
I
MEAN
TO
LECTURE
YOU
A
LITTLE
UPON
THEIR
ACCOUNT
MYSELF
BUT
MY
DEAR
FRANKENSTEIN
CONTINUED
HE
STOPPING
SHORT
AND
GAZING
FULL
IN
MY
FACE
I
DID
NOT
BEFORE
REMARK
HOW
VERY
ILL
YOU
APPEAR
SO
THIN
AND
PALE
YOU
LOOK
AS
IF
YOU
HAD
BEEN
WATCHING
FOR
SEVERAL
NIGHTS
YOU
HAVE
GUESSED
RIGHT
I
HAVE
LATELY
BEEN
SO
DEEPLY
ENGAGED
IN
ONE
OCCUPATION
THAT
I
HAVE
NOT
ALLOWED
MYSELF
SUFFICIENT
REST
AS
YOU
SEE
BUT
I
HOPE
I
SINCERELY
HOPE
THAT
ALL
THESE
EMPLOYMENTS
ARE
NOW
AT
AN
END
AND
THAT
I
AM
AT
LENGTH
FREE
I
TREMBLED
EXCESSIVELY
I
COULD
NOT
ENDURE
TO
THINK
OF
AND
FAR
LESS
TO
ALLUDE
TO
THE
OCCURRENCES
OF
THE
PRECEDING
NIGHT
I
WALKED
WITH
A
QUICK
PACE
AND
WE
SOON
ARRIVED
AT
MY
COLLEGE
I
THEN
REFLECTED
AND
THE
THOUGHT
MADE
ME
SHIVER
THAT
THE
CREATURE
WHOM
I
HAD
LEFT
IN
MY
APARTMENT
MIGHT
STILL
BE
THERE
ALIVE
AND
WALKING
ABOUT
I
DREADED
TO
BEHOLD
THIS
MONSTER
BUT
I
FEARED
STILL
MORE
THAT
HENRY
SHOULD
SEE
HIM
ENTREATING
HIM
THEREFORE
TO
REMAIN
A
FEW
MINUTES
AT
THE
BOTTOM
OF
THE
STAIRS
I
DARTED
UP
TOWARDS
MY
OWN
ROOM
MY
HAND
WAS
ALREADY
ON
THE
LOCK
OF
THE
DOOR
BEFORE
I
RECOLLECTED
MYSELF
I
THEN
PAUSED
AND
A
COLD
SHIVERING
CAME
OVER
ME
I
THREW
THE
DOOR
FORCIBLY
OPEN
AS
CHILDREN
ARE
ACCUSTOMED
TO
DO
WHEN
THEY
EXPECT
A
SPECTRE
TO
STAND
IN
WAITING
FOR
THEM
ON
THE
OTHER
SIDE
BUT
NOTHING
APPEARED
I
STEPPED
FEARFULLY
IN:
THE
APARTMENT
WAS
EMPTY
AND
MY
BEDROOM
WAS
ALSO
FREED
FROM
ITS
HIDEOUS
GUEST
I
COULD
HARDLY
BELIEVE
THAT
SO
GREAT
A
GOOD
FORTUNE
COULD
HAVE
BEFALLEN
ME
BUT
WHEN
I
BECAME
ASSURED
THAT
MY
ENEMY
HAD
INDEED
FLED
I
CLAPPED
MY
HANDS
FOR
JOY
AND
RAN
DOWN
TO
CLERVAL
WE
ASCENDED
INTO
MY
ROOM
AND
THE
SERVANT
PRESENTLY
BROUGHT
BREAKFAST
BUT
I
WAS
UNABLE
TO
CONTAIN
MYSELF
IT
WAS
NOT
JOY
ONLY
THAT
POSSESSED
ME
I
FELT
MY
FLESH
TINGLE
WITH
EXCESS
OF
SENSITIVENESS
AND
MY
PULSE
BEAT
RAPIDLY
I
WAS
UNABLE
TO
REMAIN
FOR
A
SINGLE
INSTANT
IN
THE
SAME
PLACE
I
JUMPED
OVER
THE
CHAIRS
CLAPPED
MY
HANDS
AND
LAUGHED
ALOUD
CLERVAL
AT
FIRST
ATTRIBUTED
MY
UNUSUAL
SPIRITS
TO
JOY
ON
HIS
ARRIVAL
BUT
WHEN
HE
OBSERVED
ME
MORE
ATTENTIVELY
HE
SAW
A
WILDNESS
IN
MY
EYES
FOR
WHICH
HE
COULD
NOT
ACCOUNT
AND
MY
LOUD
UNRESTRAINED
HEARTLESS
LAUGHTER
FRIGHTENED
AND
ASTONISHED
HIM
MY
DEAR
VICTOR
CRIED
HE
WHAT
FOR
GODS
SAKE
IS
THE
MATTER
DO
NOT
LAUGH
IN
THAT
MANNER
HOW
ILL
YOU
ARE!
WHAT
IS
THE
CAUSE
OF
ALL
THIS
DO
NOT
ASK
ME
CRIED
I
PUTTING
MY
HANDS
BEFORE
MY
EYES
FOR
I
THOUGHT
I
SAW
THE
DREADED
SPECTRE
GLIDE
INTO
THE
ROOM
*HE*
CAN
TELL
OH
SAVE
ME!
SAVE
ME!
I
IMAGINED
THAT
THE
MONSTER
SEIZED
ME
I
STRUGGLED
FURIOUSLY
AND
FELL
DOWN
IN
A
FIT
POOR
CLERVAL!
WHAT
MUST
HAVE
BEEN
HIS
FEELINGS
A
MEETING
WHICH
HE
ANTICIPATED
WITH
SUCH
JOY
SO
STRANGELY
TURNED
TO
BITTERNESS
BUT
I
WAS
NOT
THE
WITNESS
OF
HIS
GRIEF
FOR
I
WAS
LIFELESS
AND
DID
NOT
RECOVER
MY
SENSES
FOR
A
LONG
LONG
TIME
THIS
WAS
THE
COMMENCEMENT
OF
A
NERVOUS
FEVER
WHICH
CONFINED
ME
FOR
SEVERAL
MONTHS
DURING
ALL
THAT
TIME
HENRY
WAS
MY
ONLY
NURSE
I
AFTERWARDS
LEARNED
THAT
KNOWING
MY
FATHERS
ADVANCED
AGE
AND
UNFITNESS
FOR
SO
LONG
A
JOURNEY
AND
HOW
WRETCHED
MY
SICKNESS
WOULD
MAKE
ELIZABETH
HE
SPARED
THEM
THIS
GRIEF
BY
CONCEALING
THE
EXTENT
OF
MY
DISORDER
HE
KNEW
THAT
I
COULD
NOT
HAVE
A
MORE
KIND
AND
ATTENTIVE
NURSE
THAN
HIMSELF
AND
FIRM
IN
THE
HOPE
HE
FELT
OF
MY
RECOVERY
HE
DID
NOT
DOUBT
THAT
INSTEAD
OF
DOING
HARM
HE
PERFORMED
THE
KINDEST
ACTION
THAT
HE
COULD
TOWARDS
THEM
BUT
I
WAS
IN
REALITY
VERY
ILL
AND
SURELY
NOTHING
BUT
THE
UNBOUNDED
AND
UNREMITTING
ATTENTIONS
OF
MY
FRIEND
COULD
HAVE
RESTORED
ME
TO
LIFE
THE
FORM
OF
THE
MONSTER
ON
WHOM
I
HAD
BESTOWED
EXISTENCE
WAS
FOREVER
BEFORE
MY
EYES
AND
I
RAVED
INCESSANTLY
CONCERNING
HIM
DOUBTLESS
MY
WORDS
SURPRISED
HENRY
HE
AT
FIRST
BELIEVED
THEM
TO
BE
THE
WANDERINGS
OF
MY
DISTURBED
IMAGINATION
BUT
THE
PERTINACITY
WITH
WHICH
I
CONTINUALLY
RECURRED
TO
THE
SAME
SUBJECT
PERSUADED
HIM
THAT
MY
DISORDER
INDEED
OWED
ITS
ORIGIN
TO
SOME
UNCOMMON
AND
TERRIBLE
EVENT
BY
VERY
SLOW
DEGREES
AND
WITH
FREQUENT
RELAPSES
THAT
ALARMED
AND
GRIEVED
MY
FRIEND
I
RECOVERED
I
REMEMBER
THE
FIRST
TIME
I
BECAME
CAPABLE
OF
OBSERVING
OUTWARD
OBJECTS
WITH
ANY
KIND
OF
PLEASURE
I
PERCEIVED
THAT
THE
FALLEN
LEAVES
HAD
DISAPPEARED
AND
THAT
THE
YOUNG
BUDS
WERE
SHOOTING
FORTH
FROM
THE
TREES
THAT
SHADED
MY
WINDOW
IT
WAS
A
DIVINE
SPRING
AND
THE
SEASON
CONTRIBUTED
GREATLY
TO
MY
CONVALESCENCE
I
FELT
ALSO
SENTIMENTS
OF
JOY
AND
AFFECTION
REVIVE
IN
MY
BOSOM
MY
GLOOM
DISAPPEARED
AND
IN
A
SHORT
TIME
I
BECAME
AS
CHEERFUL
AS
BEFORE
I
WAS
ATTACKED
BY
THE
FATAL
PASSION
DEAREST
CLERVAL
EXCLAIMED
I
HOW
KIND
HOW
VERY
GOOD
YOU
ARE
TO
ME
THIS
WHOLE
WINTER
INSTEAD
OF
BEING
SPENT
IN
STUDY
AS
YOU
PROMISED
YOURSELF
HAS
BEEN
CONSUMED
IN
MY
SICK
ROOM
HOW
SHALL
I
EVER
REPAY
YOU
I
FEEL
THE
GREATEST
REMORSE
FOR
THE
DISAPPOINTMENT
OF
WHICH
I
HAVE
BEEN
THE
OCCASION
BUT
YOU
WILL
FORGIVE
ME
YOU
WILL
